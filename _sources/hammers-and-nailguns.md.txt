Hammers and Nailguns
====================

People often ask me, *"What is your tool for?"*

They want an answer like "AI" or "ETL" or "Training Models". <br/>
They want a clean and specific application for easy comparison.

I, of course, do not give them that satisfaction.<br/>
Instead I ask *"What is Python for?"* or *"What is the cloud for?"*

***Them:*** *Well, all sorts of different things.*<br/>
***Me:*** *Exactly!*

Unfortunately, this answer sucks.

Simple Tools, Humble Opinions
-----------------------------

The analogy I use here is of hammers and nailguns.

Nominally these tools do the same thing (nail things) <br/>
In reality they do very different things:

-  **The nail gun puts nails into wood.**  The nailgun is 10x better than a hammer at doing this.  If we have to nail 1000 nails then we should definitely get a nail gun.

-  **The hammer whacks things.**  Those things can be nails, but they can also be wrenches, or rusty bolts, or drywall, or heck, even a zombie’s head.

The hammer is a more *simple* tool and the intention behind its design is more *humble*.  The hammer's design doesn't assume it knows what we want to do.

I own a hammer, not a nailgun.  I use it for all sorts of things (most recently
to tap in drywall anchors).  I can’t recall the last time I actually nailed
something with it.  Nailguns are better at nailing things, but it’s rare that
that’s exactly what I want.  Nailguns make enough assumptions about what I want
to do that they’re rarely the right tool for me.

Home improvement, like Python, is a place where all sorts of strange problems
arise, and it’s great to have simple and flexible tools that extend our natural
abilities (like whacking things) in any situation.

Nailguns are easier to market
-----------------------------

Writing copy for nailguns is easy

***Nailguns:*** *"Sink nails 10x faster, save time and energy!"*

Hammers are harder

***Hammers:*** *"Whack things!  So useful!"*

Hammers have more applications and are far more commonly used.
However the lack of a single "killer application" (just thousands of mundane
ones) makes them awkward to pitch successfully.

I Like Hammers
--------------

As a craftsman (in both wood and code) I like hammers.  Hammers extend our
natural abilities just a little (naturally our bodies can hit things, just not
as hard).  They fit in our hands, are simple, and are intuitive to use in any
situation.

We especially need hammers in unpredictable situations, which is exactly where
Python data devs live.  Python devs are the tip of an organizations
problem-solving spear.  They always get asked to tackle the wacky new dataset
or computational modality.  Their problems are always novel and untested.  Of
course for any problem we would prefer a purpose built tool, but the market
rarely responds to our needs that quickly, and by the time it does it's usually
someone else's problem.

Simple tools with humble opinions like hammers are what I reach for when I
face a new problem.  They're difficult to justify in words, but I couldn't
live without them.
