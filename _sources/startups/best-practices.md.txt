Best Practices
==============

Background
----------

After building a successful open source project, I then started a company and made many mistakes.

Some folks walking along the same path foolishly ask for my advice.
This article encodes some of that advice.
It is intended for technical founders who have no experience making companies.

Most Advice is Wrong
--------------------

Many people will offer you advice:

-   Investors
-   Angel investors
-   Business partners
-   Fractional CTO/CMO/COO/CRO folks
-   Other founders (like me)

We're all mostly wrong.  That's not because we're dumb (we're mostly not dumb)
but our experiences were valid for our situations, and they probably don't
transfer over to yours.

Early stage companies are all pretty unique, and it may be that there isn't a
lot of transferability of knowledge.  Unfortunately, the wisest person
for your situation is probably yourself.  You're going to feel pretty lost
(that's ok, you are) but you should probably just follow your gut most of the
time and see where that takes you.

Given that, I encourage you to read and then discount the advice below.


On Hiring
---------

### Hire Experienced Folks

You should certainly employ folks though, and you should listen to them.
They should all be smart; ideally smarter than you.

You don't want any interns or junior folks.  No one on your team has time to
grow them.  You'd be doing them a disservice; early stage startups
are a horrible place to start a career.  Junior folks need structure.  You want
people who are smarter than you.

You've succeeded in finding someone when you can say "Oh, so-and-so has that
problem, I don't need to think about it anymore."

### Hire Nimble Folks

So hire experienced people, hire people with opinions, but avoid people who have a plan.
Your first ten plans will fail.  You need people who can acknowledge failure
quickly and move on.

Some experienced people make a living by going into early companies and running
a well-known playbook.  This will be great for a month and then it will be
wrong, but these people won't want to deviate from their playbook that
frequently.  These playbooks will sound enticing; they allow you to offload
responsibility for a time to an expert.  This is a lie though, you're still on
the hook.

You want people who are intellectually excited about pivoting once a month.

### Hire Independent Folks

Some people want to be told what to do.  They'll ask questions like "OK, what
are my goals for the quarter".  These people are used to much more structure
than you'll be ready to give to them.

You want to hire people who can look at the entire situation and can come up
with and change their own goals after chatting casually with you.
You can't be guiding them the entire time.

### Hire Small

A team of five gets along well together.
A team of thirty has a variety of issues:

-   personality conflicts
-   differences in culture
-   they can't all fit in a room
-   they need management structure (and will then start to care about titles
    and hierarchy and such)

Before long you'll find that instead of solving important problems you're
spending all of your time managing a group of people.

Given that you're going to fail ten times before you find the right path, it's
best to keep the team pretty small.  They won't go as far, but it'll be way
easier to bring everyone along as you explore the space.

It's like walking down the street with friends.  Two people can walk pretty
quickly even around obstacles, but thirty people walk really slowly and get
bogged down with unexpected obstructions occur.  It's just hard to redirect the
group of thirty without *a lot* of emotional work.

Stay small until you have actual revenue that you think you can scale.
Staying small will also enable you to pay for really good people.
One really good person is worth more than five ok people, which are worth
infinitely more than fifty junior people.  You individually are probably faster
than fifty junior people.


### Hire Consistent Culture

Do you care mostly about ...

-   Making money?
-   Changing the world?
-   Building a diverse and inclusive workplace?

Pick one.

Then make sure that everyone with hiring authority on the early team picks the same one.
Otherwise you'll have to fire a bunch of people down the road.

### Fire People

This is a hard lesson to learn, but you'll know that you'll need to fire
someone, and then you'll try for a few more months to make it work.  This will
be bad for everyone and so very bad for the company.

Fire early.  It'll suck, but everyone (including the firee) will feel better
afterwards.

Investors
---------

### Take the Money

Investors may be offering you more money than you need.  That's ok.
Take the money.  Money is useful.  It can be turned into good people, time to
relax and regroup, experimentation, offloading dumb problems onto contractors.
Don't worry about being overvalued.  Don't worry about overly high expectations.
Just take the money.

### VCs primary value is money

They will offer you a variety of help in starting out.  This help may have some
value, but not much.  It's easy to find advice.  Their experts are smart, but
they don't know your business well and so you'll outgrow them in a couple of
months.

### Choose people who understand your space

Even though they won't be able to help you, it's really nice to have people who
understand what you're doing so that you don't have to explain everything to
them.


Authenticity and Mental Health
------------------------------

### There's no recipe to being a CEO

Often folks feel stressed because they feel like they often need to behave in a
certain way:

1.  You must know what you're doing
2.  You must present optimism to the team and to the world
3.  You must have a coherent vision for the future

Screw that.  No sane person has that much confidence.  Most startups fail,
including yours.  This is the sort of unreasonably high expectations that lead
to burnout for you and corrosive behavior to the team.

You're a human, and you've been a pretty successful human up until this point.
You should probably keep doing whatever it was were doing before.  There's no
reason to change your behavior.  Instead, change the company to suit you.


### Optimize for yourself

You're going to be the bottleneck of your company.
It's ok if you optimize for yourself.

-   Hate Slack?  Push the company to mailing lists and Github.
-   Hate regularly scheduled meetings?  Push for asynchronous communication and ad-hoc meetings?
-   Want to take some time off?  Define a vacation policy that suits your needs.

You're being selfish and that's ok.  It's also probably what's best for the company.


Voice
-----

### Branding

Hire a group for this.  Your investors will have contacts.  Pay those
contractors a bunch (like $50-100k).

### Messaging

Do this yourself.  You can find people to hire to do this, but you'll spend a
bunch of your time explaining things to them, having them translate your words
poorly to a lower common denominator, and then spend a bunch more time
struggling to make them right.

It's easier and better if you do this yourself for a while, and learn whatever
you need along the way.


Scale
-----

A common refrain we hear is "but this won't scale".  This applies to early
sales contracts, early product ideas, technology choices, and so on.  It's ok,
your job is to build something, not to build something scalable.  *Eventually*
the thing will need to scale, but you don't need to do that first.

Tesla started with the Tesla Roadster, a fully electric sports car that cost
around $250,000.  About 2,500 were ever made.  This product didn't scale.  The
market of people willing to pay that much for a car is small, and the
manufacturing process wasn't smooth.  It didn't matter though, it allowed the
company to experiment and iterate quickly so that they could then produce the
Model 3.  It's ok to start out by building the Roadster.

First build a thing, then build a thing that scales.
Building a thing that scales right from the start reduces your chance of eventual success.
