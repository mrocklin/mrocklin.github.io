Decision Fatigue
================

Making decisions is hard work, even if the decisions are low stakes.
As proof consider the following questions from your ordinary life:

-   *"Where we want to eat tonight?"*
-   *"Which of these five nearly-identical toothpaste brands is best for me?"*
-   *"Should I buy this expensive item?"*

These decisions cause fatigue.
In a work setting we help our team by taking on the burden of making good decisions.

When this comes up
------------------

If I've directed you to this article it's because you were in charge of
a thing, ran into a roadblock, and then said one of the following:

-   *"What do we want to do in this situation?"*
-   *"How do we feel about X?"*
-   *"How do we want to proceed?"*

It's good that when you feel uncertain you ask for input.  Good job üëç.

However, the phrasing of your question shifts the burden from your shoulders to
the group.  This I don't like as much.  Instead, I recommend the following phrasing.

-   *"I'm figuring out X, but I'm running into a problem and I could use some advice."*

    *"Here is what I want to achieve ..."*

    *"This is where I'm getting stuck ..."*

    *"Without input I would probably do the following ..."*

With this phrasing you keep the burden on your shoulders,
and merely ask the group for advice.  This is easy for others!  Everyone loves giving advice üéâ

The second phrasing makes it easy for your colleagues to help without asking them to make a decision.
You continue to carry the burden of glory/shame if things go well/poorly.


Context vs Control
------------------

This feels like the flip-side of Netflix's value, *Context vs Control*.

As a manager I work to give folks context so that they can make good decisions
on the ground on their own.  No one wants me micro-managing.  People like
this behavior.  People like to control their work.

However, part of context vs control is that the team member shouldn't give back
control when the going gets tough.  They should own the hard decisions (taking
in a lot of input from others of course).  If you're going to ask someone else to make
the hard decisions then you should have them do that work directly.

-   It sucks not being able to control your own work
-   It sucks having to control other work for which you're not on the ground

Of course, if you're feeling genuinely out of your depth then definitely send
control (and context) back up the chain of command and ask for different work.


Final Thoughts
--------------

I suspect that people generally agree / find obvious what I wrote above.  The
one thing I find isn't well understood is the interpretation of these two
different phrases:

-   *"What do we want to do here?"*  (Burdens the team with the decision)
-   *"I'm figuring out what to do here and could use some advice"*  (Keeps the
    burden on your shoulders)

I really like it when people do the second thing.
