-   ## Mission

    I maintain open source software for Python's data ecosystem.

    I do this to increase accessibility to computation and in so doing accelerate science and inform policy decisions for the broader public.

-   ## Current Work

    I am primarily known for [Dask](https://dask.org), a library for scalable computing with dynamic task scheduling.

    I also run a startup company [Coiled](https://coiled.io).
