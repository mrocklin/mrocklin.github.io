# Matthew Rocklin

Hello 👋!

My name is Matt, and I write software.

I work in the open source Python data/compute ecosystem.<br/>
I've worked on plenty, but I'm mostly known for the following:

-  [Dask](https://dask.org): a library for parallel computing
-  [Coiled](https://coiled.io): a small startup around cloud deployment

Along with working on various other projects, like `toolz`, `sympy`, `theano`, etc..

I do this work both because it's fun, and to increase accessibility to computation, helping us and accelerate science and inform policy decisions for the broader public good.

I write about my work, both technical and human aspects.
You can read about that on this site.
