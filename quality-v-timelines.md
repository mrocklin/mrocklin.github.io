Quality v. Timelines
====================

When doing or scoping work we often ask ourselves *"should I do a good job here,
or a good-enough job?"*  This affects project velocity both short and long
term.

To address this question, I'm going to introduce two professionals from my friends/family.

## Doctor

My good friend is an OB/GYN.  She spends a lot of her time in delivery/surgery,
taking various things out of humans (babies, cysts, cancers, organs, birth
control, unknown fluids, etc.).  It's a messy and unpredictable job that has to be
done *exactly correctly*.  The most important task around is the patient right in
front of her.  Nothing else takes precedence.

## Carpenter

My uncles all worked at Paramount studios.  They built/painted/set-up various
stage props for the movies (fun fact, my grandpa painted the Yellow Brick Road
from the Wizard of Oz).  They had to do a professional job, but they also had
to deliver on time.  Their work was not the most important task around.  The
shoot was.

## Is my task the most important thing?

The question of "good vs good-enough" often comes down to "is my task the most
important thing?".

Often we're asked to do work that is not the most-important-thing (like my
uncles on the movie set).  In this case we do the best we can in the time
allotted, and then we get out of the way leaving something that is good-enough.
Staying on set painting something just-right while the cast and crew are
standing around isn't going to work.  We need to move our task off of the
critical path.  If we're great at our job (leaders / managers / etc.) then we
measure our progress by how many things we can move off of the critical path in
the time allotted to help our crew.

Occasionally we're asked to do work that is the most-important-thing (like my
friend the doctor).  In this case we stay on the job until it's done perfectly,
even if it goes way over schedule.  We don't leave the birthing mother, we make
sure that our sutures aren't going to rip, and we verify that we didn't leave
gauze in the patient.  In these cases the rest of the world revolves around us
(patient, nursing staff, support staff, other patients in the waiting room),
and so it's very important that we communicate actively and constantly to let
everyone know what to expect.

## Verify

Answering "good vs good-enough" well helps groups to move quickly without
incurring technical debt where it matters.  It makes sense to check in with
your team to make sure that everyone agrees on what is most important, and
where quality is important but not critical.
