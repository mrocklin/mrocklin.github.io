Hiring Sales
============

We're restarting our sales organization a couple years after firing our old
one.  It's an interesting challenge finding just the right person.  This post
goes into a bit of our history, what I'm looking for in an early sales hire,
and my experience engaging with this process.

This post may interest you if ...

1.  You're interviewing for a sales job with me and I've pointed you to this post
2.  You're curious about startups generally
3.  You want to recommend someone in your network (please do!)

History
-------

A couple years ago we had a sales team, but our product was bad and so the
sales team was premature.  We fired them (and a bunch of other people) and
focused on making a delightful product.

Because we didn't have a sales team we focused on making a product that a user
could on-board, use, and pay for all without talking to us.  Surprisingly, this
worked, and today we have a nice machine that generates happy champions within
small teams that pay low thousands of dollars per month (but rarely more).

These people pay us money, but not that much.  We've been encouraged by two
recent learnings:

1.  A little bit of customer support as they onboard greatly accelerates consumption
2.  After talking to customers, we realize that there are often much larger
    opportunities just behind the initial team that lands with us.

Given this, we're hiring a sales team again.

Team Composition
----------------

Ideally we want people who have three skills:

1.  **Know how to sell stuff**

    Knows how to empower champions, navigate an org chart, find economic
    buyers, identify pain and goals, speak to that pain and those goals,
    negotiate with precurement and legal, etc..

2.  **Know our space** (data infrastructure, open source, Python)

    Familiar with Python/Spark/Cloud/Devops/Data/ML/...  So when someone says
    that they're having trouble with Argo, know that that means "workflow
    management" and direct them to the right solution.

    There's a lot of incidental complexity here that takes a while to learn.

3.  **Are intellectually curious**, comfortable in startups,  and excited to be
    creative and invent new systems

    There's really nothing in place to define how to do your job.  Hopefully
    this excites rather than scares you.  Also, we have a distinct
    communication style (direct, critical, thoughtful) and hopefully you click
    with that.

This person probably doesn't exist, so we'll happily settle for 2/3, and we'll
just build a team to round things out.  Probably this team looks a little like
...

-  Account Executive
-  Sales Engineer
-  Field Engineer

Interviewing AEs is Hard
------------------------

We've got good candiates for Field and Sales Engineers.  AEs are harder for us
to connect to.  There are lots of great candidates out there, but it's been
harder to come to a sense of conviction with someone, than with SEs / FEs.

My experience interviewing AEs so far has been that they say fairly generic
things like:

-  I'll succeed by finding the buyer, figuring out what their pain is, and then
   demonstrating how we solve that pain
-  I did this with big name company X, where I built the relationship over many
   months
-  We shoould sell where the money is
-  ...

Everyone says these things, and while I wholeheartedly agree with these points,
it's hard to get them to say anything specific about our situation, or even to
ask questions about our situation that would let them answer things more
effectively.

So, AEs that I interview, here's the cheat code:

-   Assume that I know more about sales than a typical engineer
    (you don't need to explain basic concepts to me)
-   Get to a point in our conversation where we are conversing about strategy.
    To do this you will likely need to ...
    -   become a lot smarter about our situation pretty quickly,
        this probably means asking useful questions
    -   pause and think
-   If it looks like I want to say something, notice, and open some space.
    I'm very interested in how well we can communicate.

The number of otherwise qualified AEs that come in and give the impression that
they have all the answers (despite not knowing much about our situation) is odd
to me.  My *guess* is that they're assuming that I'm looking for someone to say
"everything's going to be ok, I've got this" convincingly enough. To me
saying that with conviction but without understanding our situation is a
strongly negative signal.

What I'm actually looking for is someone who can demonstrate that they're able
to think and solve my problem specifically, not today, but over many months
after failing quickly many times and thinking through new strategies.  My
assumption is that any answer you have today is likely wrong, so if you have
strong conviction on that answer I'll probably assume that you're mentally
inflexible.

FAQs
----

To accelerate the interview process a bit, here are some frequently asked
questions by sales folks:

-   **Q:** What is your runway?

    **A:** We have a bit over two years, assuming we don't make any money

-   **Q:** What are your goals?

    **A:** I'd love to get to $5mm ARR in that time (but you tell me what you
    think is feasible, and we'll adjust strategy together) probably with a
    mixture of small and large deals.

-   **Q:** How much room is there to grow?  (could I end up managing sales?)

    **A:** Yes, if you're good.  I don't promise anything though.
    Honestly, if you're really good then you can have my job :)
