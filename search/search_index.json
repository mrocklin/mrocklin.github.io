My initial results showed that Dask.dataframes were overall much faster, somewhere like 5x.</p> <p>These results were wrong.  They weren't wrong in a factual sense, and the experiments that I ran were clear and reproducible, but there was so much bias in how I selected, set up, and ran those experiments that the end result was misleading.  After checking results myself and then having other experts come in and check my results I now see much more sensible numbers.  At the moment both projects are within a factor of two most of the time, with some interesting exceptions either way.</p> <p>This blogpost outlines the ways in which library authors can fool themselves when performing benchmarks, using my recent experience as an anecdote.  I hope that this encourages authors to check themselves, and encourages readers to be more critical of numbers that they see in the future.</p> <p>This problem exists as well in academic research.

I wonder how the competition fares?</p> <p>Every project is developed with different applications in mind and so has different strengths and weaknesses.  If we approach a benchmark caring only about our original objectives and dismissing the objectives of the other projects then we'll very likely trick ourselves.</p> <p>For example consider reading CSV files.  Dask's CSV reader is based off of Pandas' CSV reader, which was the target of great effort and love; this is because CSV was so important to the finance community where Pandas grew up. Spark's CSV solution is less awesome, but that's less about the quality of Spark and more a statement about how Spark users tend not to use CSV.  When they use text-based formats they're much more likely to use line-delimited JSON, which is typical in Spark's common use cases (web diagnostics, click logs, and so on).  Pandas/Dask came from the scientific and finance worlds where CSV is king while Spark came from the web world where JSON reigns.</p> <p>Conversely, Dask.dataframe hasn't bothered to hook up the <code>pandas.read_json</code> function to Dask.dataframe yet.  Surprisingly it rarely comes up.  Both projects can correctly say that the other project's solution to what they consider the standard text-based file format is less-than-awesome.  Comparing performance here either way will likely lead to misguided conclusions.</p> <p>So when benchmarking data ingestion maybe we look around a bit, see that both claim to support Parquet well, and use that as the basis for comparison.</p>"},{"location":"biased-benchmarks/#skewed-experience","title":"Skewed Experience","text":"<p>Whoa, this other project has a lot of configuration parameters!  Let's just use the defaults.</p> <p>Software is often easy to set up, but often requires experience to set up optimally.  Authors are naturally more adept at setting up their own software than the software of their competition.</p> <p>My original (and flawed) solution to this was to \"just use the defaults\" on both projects.  Given my inability to tune Spark (there are several dozen parameters) I decided to also not tune Dask and run under default settings.  I figured that this would be a good benchmark not only of the software, but also on choices for sane defaults, which is a good design principle in itself.</p> <p>This failed spectacularly because I was making unconscious decisions like the size of machines that I was using for the experiment, CPU/memory ratios, and so on. It turns out that Spark's defaults are optimized for very small machines (or more likely, small YARN containers) and use only 1GB of memory per executor by default while Dask is typically run on larger boxes or has the full use of a single machine in a single shared-memory process.  My standard cluster configurations were biased towards Dask before I even considered running a benchmark.</p> <p>Similarly the APIs of software projects are complex and for any given problem there is often both a fast way and a general-but-slow way.  Authors naturally choose the fast way on their own system but inadvertently choose the general way that comes up first when reading documentation for the other project.  It often takes months of hands-on experience to understand a project well enough to definitely say that you're not doing things in a dumb way.</p> <p>In both cases I think the only solution is to collaborate with someone that primarily uses the other system.</p>"},{"location":"biased-benchmarks/#preference-towards-strengths","title":"Preference towards strengths","text":"<p>Oh hey, we're doing really well here.

It's for sister projects like RAPIDS, Prefect, Pangeo/Xarray, XGBoost, and so on that Dask supports.  As a community project, Dask tries hard to blend in and support peer projects.

It was fun working with devs from various projects (Dask, Arrow, Polars, Spark) in the week leading up to the event. Thought I'd share a re-recording of it here</p> <p>youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g_U</p> <p>This is the result of a couple weeks of work comparing large data frameworks on benchmarks ranging in size 10GB to 10TB. No project wins. It's really interesting analyzing results though.</p> <p>DuckDB and Dask are the only projects that reliably finish things (although possibly Dask's success here has to do with me knowing Dask better than the others). DuckDB is way faster at small scale (along with Polars). Dask and Spark are generally more robust and performant at large scale, mostly because they're able to parallelize S3 access. Really-good-S3 access seems to be the way you win at real-world cloud performance.</p> <p>Looking more deeply at Dask results, we're wildly inefficient. There's at least a 2x-5x performance increase to be had here. Given that Dask does about as well as any other project on cloud this really means that no one has optimized cloud well yet.</p> <p>This talk also goes into how we attempted to address bias (super hard to do in benchmarks). We had active collaborations with Polars and Spark people (made Polars quite a bit faster during this process actually). See https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html for more thoughts.</p> <p>This also shows the improvement Dask made in the last six months. Dask used to suck at benchmarks. Now it doesn't win, but reliably places among the top. This is due to ...</p> <ol> <li>Arrow strings</li> <li>New shuffling algorithms</li> <li>Query optimization</li> </ol> <p>There's a lot of work for projects like Dask and Polars to fix themselves up in this space. They're both moving pretty fast right now. I'm curious to see how they progress in the next few months.</p> <p>For future work I'd like to expand this out a bit beyond TPC-H. TPC-H is great because they're fairly serious queries (lots of tables, lots of joins) and not micro-benchmarks. We could use broader coverage though.

This affects how we market ourselves, how we price the product, and what kind of sales team we build:</p> <p>What choices do we have?  Mostly we break down this choice by company/team size:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Individuals: we target individual data professionals to use our platform,     kinda like Github does</p> <ul> <li>Marketing: highly technical online content, maybe some events, focusing     on ease of use and accelerating work</li> <li>Pricing: mostly free with a possibility of swiping a credit card for up     to a few hundred dollars a month (typically the budget for individual     data professionals)</li> <li>Sales: no sales team, must be self-serve (we can't hand-hold     individuals, and sales teams will want commissions)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Small teams: we serve small teams of data professionals, talking mostly     to the team lead, who cares mostly about getting work done, but also has to     justify costs</p> <ul> <li>Marketing: a mix of highly technical content with some business value     thrown in as well</li> <li>Pricing: free tier is useful for trials, but we expect to charge a few     thousand a month, either with a corporate card or with a purchase order     (typically the budget for a team lead without getting higher approval)</li> <li>Sales: maybe rely on a self-serve motion to get people in the door,     and then try to sell them to pre-commit to greater usage with     discounted rates.  This requires a lightweight sales team attached to     a product that can sell itself.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Enterprise: we target entire companies, probably talking to some IT     architect, or a CTO.  They care about accelerating the company, and also     about costs, security, and generally not causing a panic.</p> <ul> <li>Marketing: focus on business value with a simpler technical message.     Some online content but direct outreach.</li> <li>Pricing: $100,000-$1,000,000s, probably after a POC and with some     healthy support contract thrown in</li> <li>Sales: this is a high contact sales process that takes many months.     This requires a sizable and expensive team working full time on chasing     down new deals and working those deals to completion.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>As a company we could play at any of these levels.  Dask has great community adoption and could leverage those users into a strong individual userbase (like GitHub).  Alternatively, we're also heavily used inside of large organizations (banks, government, healthcare, etc.) that are used to paying millions of dollars for a product like ours, and so an Enterprise play could also make sense.</p> <p>Which market we go after affects our choices about sales and marketing.  What do we choose?</p> <p>Most of the money is in large enterprise sales.  It's hard to find a company in our space (data infrastructure) bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars where most of that money doesn't come from large enterprise contracts.  We have a few of these already, mostly focused around Dask support, and we like them.</p> <p>However, selling into these companies has a long lead time, long iteration cycles, and poor visibility/learning due to stringent security.  For this reason, we've focused on the less lucrative, but more informative individual and small teams groups.  This allows us to focus on a cloud SaaS product, which gives us a lot of visibility into usage, which we leverage to accelerate product velocity.</p> <p>Our thesis is that by starting with small teams we can more rapidly iterate towards a delightful experience, which we can then pivot to larger enterprise for real money.

He raised the following question:</p> <p>At what point do we transition from core data representations like <code>dicts</code> to custom data representations with custom classes?</p> <p>Choices in data representation interest me quite a bit.  I think that the mechanisms we choose to store and share data strongly impact the longevity of the code that we write.</p> <p>Let's borrow Shannon's book example to compare two common options of data representation</p> <pre><code>\" Book object \"                                 \" Plain Dictionary \"\n\nclass Book(object):\n    def __init__(self, authors, title, isbn):\n        self.authors = authors\n        self.title = title\n        self.isbn = isbn\n                                                book = {\nbook = Book([\"Neil Gaiman\"],                        \"authors\": [\"Neil Gaiman\"],\n            \"American Gods\",                        \"title\": \"American Gods\",\n            \"9780062113450\")                        \"isbn\": \"9780062113450\"\n                                                }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Shannon advocates that you should \"Keep it Simple\" (right) for simple data structures but that, once things become more complex, you should transition to an object (left).</p> <p>I think that most Python programmers would agree with this sentiment.  It's unclear (and thus interesting) exactly when this transition occurs though.  Personally I use core data structures (like <code>dict</code>) to represent almost all of my data.  I create new classes very rarely.  I follow this practice because I believe in the principle of shared abstractions.  I'll explain what I mean in a moment.</p>"},{"location":"shared-abstractions/#advantages-of-objects","title":"Advantages of Objects","text":"<p>To start, lets state some of the virtues of objects (this is a very incomplete list.)</p> <ul> <li> <p>Historically they're just more commonly used for complex data.  It's important to maintain coding standards that existing programmers find comfortable.</p> </li> <li> <p>The attribute syntax is a lot nicer.  Compare the following syntax to access an attribute:</p> <pre><code>book[\"authors\"]      # 11 characters to get attribute, 4 of them awkward to type\nbook.authors         #  8 characters to get attribute, all of them common\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>We can add functionality/methods to the objects in a controlled namespace.  For example</p> <p><pre><code>book.open()         .open clearly belongs to book\nopen(book)          open conflicts with standard Python function to open a file\n</code></pre> The attribute syntax note is convenient but not a game-changer.  The ability to associate a set of functions with the object (and reuse these functions on inherited classes) is really where objects shine.  To emulate this behavior with core data structures you need to respect namespaces</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>import bookpy\nbookpy.open(book)\n</code></pre> <p>And culturally many of us (myself included) are pretty bad at this.</p>"},{"location":"shared-abstractions/#advantages-of-dicts","title":"Advantages of Dicts","text":"<p>There are some small advantages to using dicts like the following</p> <ul> <li>Literal syntax, we can jump right in and write down dicts without setting up a class first.</li> <li>Efficient implementation (dicts are really fast)</li> </ul> <p>But, like the object attribute syntax these are merely convenient.</p> <p>The major reason to prefer core data structures is that they are an abstraction shared among all Python programmers.  As a result you can depend on standard code to just work on your data.</p> <p>For example we can serialize our data into JSON if, for example, we wanted to serialize it and send it over the internet.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json\n&gt;&gt;&gt; book = {\n...     \"authors\": [\"Neil Gaiman\"],\n...     \"title\": \"American Gods\",\n...     \"isbn\": \"9780062113450\"\n... }\n&gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(book)\n'{\"title\": \"American Gods\", \"isbn\": \"9780062113450\", \"authors\": [\"Neil Gaiman\"]}'\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>json</code> library fails to transform our <code>book</code> object however.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json\n&gt;&gt;&gt; book = Book([\"Neil Gaiman\"], \"American Gods\", \"9780062113450\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(book)\nTypeError: &lt;__main__.Book object at 0x10e4410&gt; is not JSON serializable\n</code></pre> <p>This is to be expected.  The <code>json</code> library developers have not seen our Book class.  No one has but us.</p> <p>While we may not think we need <code>json</code> encoding it's likely that if our project succeeds then someone will want to send our objects over the internet.  The decision to make a custom class shuts our project off from the rest of the development ecosystem.</p> <p>Custom classes inhibit interoperation with other libraries.  This limits growth out to unanticipated applications.  This is particularly tragic because our field thrives on connecting isolated components.  Shared abstractions serve as the connection links, like the regular bumps and divots in LEGO pieces.  Shared abstractions allow us to connect cool modules to create novel cool projects with ease.  Otherwise we're stuck hacking together missing technology (like a <code>Book.write_json</code> method) when perfectly adequate solutions (like <code>json.dumps</code>) already exist.</p> <p>This example isn't restricted to JSON encoding, in general we're going to have to hack something together every time we want the Book objects to interact with foreign code.

This is certainly the case when you have a large developer base that can all agree on exactly the interface they want to use.  LEGO piece bumps aren't the right fit for everyone.  If you have a large community you can establish other cool interfaces (like Lincoln Logs or Tinker Toys) but only if you have sufficient market power to do so.  No one buys the off-brand LEGOs that don't quite fit.</p> <p>The <code>numpy.ndarray</code> object is a perfect example of a custom class that has become a shared abstraction for the entire scientific computing ecosystem.  Object orientation provided convenient syntax and intelligent method handling of <code>numpy.ndarrays</code> and <code>numpy.matrix</code>.  I think that these features were key to this module's wide adoption/success and a clear win for the object oriented crowd.</p> <p>In short, I think that new classes are really awesome but only in really rare cases.  They should be used sparingly.

Slack is a great way for colleagues within an institution or group to communicate real-time with chat, voice, or video. Slack is probably the most polished of the enterprise chat tools, and today is something that probably most companies and collaborations should use.</p> <p>However internal real-time chat systems are, I think, bad for productivity generally, especially for public open source software maintenance.

I prefer GitHub because I want to ...</p> <ol> <li> <p>Engage collaborators that aren't on our Slack</p> <ol> <li> <p>External collaborators may have the answers that we need.  Having the     conversation in a private place means that we can't ask them for their     help, or, if we do eventually need to ask them for help, we need to     summarize the entire conversation that we've had privately, which     wastes time.</p> <p>Individual open source maintainers often don't know the answers that people ask, but they do know how to redirect to someone who does. More often than not, that person is in another institution.  If you ask your question on GitHub this redirection is easy.</p> </li> <li> <p>External collaborators may have questions or context that we need.     Their questions and experience can help us create a better product than     we're capable of producing with only our in-house expertise.</p> <p>Most important problems are useful across many organizations, while solutions built within one organization are often overly-specific to the needs of that organization.  By getting broader context, OSS has a much higher likelihood of success.</p> </li> <li> <p>External collaborators are much more likely to buy in to whatever we     come up with if they were able to see the reasoning behind it and     participate during that conversation.</p> <p></p> <p>If you open the design process to the creators and users of the previous 14 standards, the 15th standard has a much higher probability of actually being used.</p> </li> </ol> <p>As we adopt community maintained open source software, the team we work with extends beyond our institution, and beyond the people who listen in to all of our institution's Slack conversations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Record the conversation in case participants change in the future.</p> <p>Most development efforts change hands over time.  We may work on this project today, but next month some of us will probably move on to other projects and new people will arrive.  These new developers ask questions about why something was done and there are one of two answers, depending on whether the conversation was on Slack or GitHub:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Slack: We had a conversation about this a while ago and decided     that it was the right course of action.  Just go with it.</p> </li> <li> <p>GitHub: Go look at Issue #1234 and you'll be able to see the    reasoning why, who had which opinions, and whether or not your concern    was raised there.  If your concern wasn't raised there then we can    easily pick up that thread of conversation on GitHub a year later    (this happens all the time in long running OSS projects).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Even in the same group we often find that people repeat the same conversations.  If there is an obvious place for that conversation, and you need to scroll through previous comments, then it's far less likely that people will have to repeat themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve the silent majority of users who search the web for answers to     their questions or bugs.</p> <p>On Slack, maintainers get asked the same questions daily.  We have people ask for \"a few minutes of our time\" every few minutes.  We strongly prefer to answer questions once in a place where future users can find the answer from a web search.  This includes people outside the company, but also people within the company.</p> <p>Maintainers are much happier devoting a lot of time to craft a high quality answer to questions if those questions and answers can help others in the future.  I personally spend a lot of time crafting answers on Stack Overflow, while I usually ignore questions on chat systems.  Want a good answer?  Pose a good question in a public place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encourage thoughtful discourse.     Because GitHub is a permanent record it forces people to think more before     they write.  This is hard on casual conversation, yes, but we're not here     for casual conversation.  Asking people to spend a minute crafting comments     generally results in a conversation that is higher functioning, more     concise, and much easier to review later.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cross reference issues.     Slack is siloed.  It doesn't allow people to cross reference people or     conversations across Slacks.  OSS maintainers get invited to literally     dozens of Slack organizations.  It is not feasible to manage dozens of     Slack tabs and different siloed organziations.</p> <p>GitHub is public and conversations across different projects can easily cross reference each other.  This encourages collaboration between projects and avoids wheel-reinvention.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Slack is the easy choice.  It's so much easier just to open up a one-on-one conversation with someone, chat with them for a bit, get your answer, and feel like you've had a productive experience.  It feels good, but is rarely the correct choice long term, especially when you add up how many times that same conversation occurs.  Putting in a bit more effort and starting (or continuing!) a well-posed conversation in a public issue tracker like GitHub is likely better for your project and for your teammates long term.</p> <p>I still love Slack for inter-personal contact.  It's great for chatting with teammates, checking in to see how people are doing emotionally, or sharing pictures about our lives.  Professionally I think it's also a good place for internal teams to do daily check-ins and sometimes to arrange short-term priorities.  Slack has many great uses, but I think that in-depth technical conversation and long-term planning aren't among them.</p>"},{"location":"stability-bias/","title":"Stability Bias","text":"<p>We often optimize more for current users than future users.</p> <p>Stability often arises as a concern when proposing changes.

I spent most of my time as a tech lead while at Anaconda, and serve in that capacity to some extent in OSS communities.  I wanted to share some of the positive behaviors that I think make for a good tech lead.</p> <p>So, what can a good tech lead do?</p>"},{"location":"technical-lead/#tech-lead-behaviors","title":"Tech lead behaviors","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Solve Hard Problems: as a start, you have to be an excellent developer.     You're going to have to rescue your teammates from difficult bugs,     and tackle the core bits of whatever you're building.</p> <p>But if you want to solve hard problems then stay a senior engineer. Technical leadership is about guiding rather than executing</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid Hard Problems: save your team time by pointing them towards     simple solutions when they suffice.</p> <p>A team lead has to provide paths to solutions that the rest of the team can easily implement.  Finding easy solutions is hard.</p> <p>A team lead often has to say \"OK, I can see that your solution works well, but I wonder if we can make it simpler by doing X.  This will probably help down the line with future maintenance.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid Technical Debt: leading a large effort is like playing chess.     You make individual moves, but you think ahead about the ramifications of     those moves.</p> <p>If the team has to spend time dealing with, or paying down technical debt then that's your fault.  You should think about simple and extensible designs, so that your teammates can solve individual problems that robustly lead to an efficient solution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Break large problems down into small ones: building something     yourself is easy.  Breaking down a large thing into small things that many     people can develop on at once in parallel is hard and requires thoughtful     design.</p> <p>In some sense, a technical lead is able to realize the \"mythical man-month\" by finding a path through the problem that exposes enough concurrency to enable acceleration through parallelism.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scope problems for your team: a small amount of scoping and support     work from you can     often save your teammates long hours of work.  This can take many forms:</p> <ul> <li>Presenting a problem in context</li> <li>Provide a recommended approach, and pointers to relevant pieces of the     code</li> <li>Tests that you think should pass that encode important behavior or make     the API clear</li> </ul> <p>As you know, a lot of software development time is spent understanding design, and exploring wrong paths.  You're probably faster at this than your teammates, and so it's a highly productive activity for you. By providing enough detail up-front you can reduce uncertainty, stress, and delays from your teammates' work, which they will appreciate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Know your team: In order to properly scope and describe tasks for your     teammates you need to know their technical capabilities and preferences     pretty well.  This arises in two components:</p> <ol> <li> <p>You can match problems to teammates based on interest.  People do a     better job on problems that excite them.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can provide more or less detail based on their experience with     these kinds of problems.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Explain your thought process: It's not enough to say \"here is a test     and a design, please implement it\".  Remember that you're not in charge of     anyone here.  Instead, you lead by providing explanation and context on why     you think a certain path is best.</p> <ul> <li>Bad: Please use algorithm X here rather than Y.</li> <li> <p>Good: I suspect that algorithm Y here will not perform well when we     have many users.  I think that it's O(n^2), which is fine for the test     cases that we have here, but given that we're expecting 10k     simultaneous users and the cost here seems to be about 5us, this turns     into <code>5us * 10k ** 2 = 10 minutes</code></p> <p>Instead, I think that algorithm X might be a better fit.  It's a bit slower when we have very few users, but should scale much better.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are a couple of reasons for this.  First, keep in mind that you're not in charge.  Overly aggressive tech-leads are unpleasant to work with.</p> <p>Second, you're supposed to teach your understanding of the system onto your coworkers, and help them progress professionally.</p> </li> <li> <p>Advocate for teammates: tech leads are unique in that they</p> <ol> <li>have respect and clout in the company</li> <li>have a lot of direct experience with individual engineers</li> <li>aren't technically responsible for anyone</li> </ol> <p>As a result they are often the best source of information about who is doing well.  While you don't have direct budget authority to give raises or promotions, you do have soft power and can advocate for great teammates.</p> <p>Conversely, you also know when someone isn't working out in the team, and can work to address problems quickly before they become serious issues.</p> <p>A tech lead is like a cool aunt/uncle.  People say things to them that they wouldn't say to siblings or parents, and they're disconnected enough to easily give insightful feedback.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communicate directly to stakeholders: a good tech lead     can talk directly to other parts of the company (product, sales, marketing).     They're also often called in to deal with important clients.</p> <p>Because of this, tech leads need to be able to turn on a certain level of professionalism, and also understand the non-technical needs of others. They need to understand why the work that they do is important to people.</p> </li> <li> <p>Listen, and avoid ego: because of this, tech leads need to listen,     and have very little ego when it comes to technical work     (I personally need to work on this).</p> <p>Rockstar developers tend to make poor tech-leads (but awesome senior engineers).</p> <p>Instead the best tech leads I know are able to tell you what course of action they think is best one minute, and then have their mind changed entirely the next minute.  This is often developed with age, or with experience working on technical projects where they are wrong (which happens often if you pay attention).</p> </li> <li> <p>Respect senior engineers: Tech leads often work alongside other senior     engineers who may have more experience as developers, but don't care to     direct the work of others.  It's important to remember that these people     are often smarter than you, and seek their technical opinion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Respect junior engineers: Tech leads often dispense critical feedback     about code to junior engineers.  This puts them at risk of appearing to be     jerks.  Good tech leads study human management skills, and how to deliver     feedback in particular.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"technical-lead/#oss-maintainers-make-good-tech-leads","title":"OSS Maintainers make good Tech Leads","text":"<p>The role of having a lot of technical context, trying to direct many others along a shared technical vision, but not actually having authority over anyone is a role familiar to many OSS maintainers.
