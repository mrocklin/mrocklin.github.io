Broadly we saw the following themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Smoothing out UX rough edges</p>\n<p>When a project goes from single-user to many users there are always various rough edges to smooth out.  These included Linux and Windows keybindings, Native Windows support (not just WSL), bugs in <code>/resume</code> and <code>/plan</code>, and much more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-agent workflows</p>\n<p>I've been exploring this space recently and seeing what I like and don't like.  I'll describe some things that I like and built into Claude Chic just below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Performance</p>\n<p>Running several long sessions concurrently stressed our use of Textual.  Various enhancments were made to smooth things out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quality of Life</p>\n<p>There are many small things that we added like support for custom themes, small screen / mobile support, and more.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, let's dig into some highlights:</p>\n<h2 id=\"multi-agent-workflows\">Multi-Agent Workflows<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#multi-agent-workflows\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The headline this week is new ways to use multiple agents together.  The idea: having Claude debate itself produces more thorough analysis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plan-swarms\">Plan Swarms<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#plan-swarms\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p><code>/plan-swarm</code> spawns multiple agents to debate implementation approaches before you commit to one:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>/plan-swarm Add caching to the API layer\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This spawns several agents, each exploring the problem from a different angle\u2014one might advocate for Redis, another for in-memory caching, a third for a hybrid approach.  They present their cases to each other, debate, and often (but not always) come to consensus. You then pick the direction that resonates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"review-agents\">Review Agents<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#review-agents\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>/reviewer\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This spawns an agent whose job is to critically examine your recent changes.  You mediate as they iterate toward agreement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"infrastructure\">Infrastructure<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#infrastructure\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Full plan mode support landed via the SDK's <code>set_permission_mode</code>, with proper tool restrictions during planning and feedback when you reject a plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-themes\">Custom Themes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#custom-themes\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Claude Chic now supports user-defined themes.  The default dark theme works well on dark terminals, but many developers prefer light backgrounds.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>/theme chic-light\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Or define your own in <code>~/.claude/chic-theme.json</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;my-theme&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;colors&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;user_border&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;#ff6600&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;assistant_border&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;#0066ff&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"the-yolo-flag\">The <code>--yolo</code> Flag<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-yolo-flag\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>For sandboxed environments where you trust the agent completely:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>claudechic<span class=\"w\"> </span>--yolo\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(Or <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> if you prefer verbosity.)</p>\n<p>This skips all permission prompts.  Use it in CI pipelines, Docker containers, or when you're feeling reckless.  The name is intentional\u2014if you're using this flag, you should know what you're doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#performance\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Multi-agent swarms exposed performance bottlenecks.  Running 5-10 agents simultaneously revealed that we were doing far too much UI work for agents you weren't looking at.</p>\n<p>Key optimizations this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deferred updates</strong>: Hidden ChatViews no longer process UI updates until you switch to them</li>\n<li><strong>Collapsed history</strong>: Old conversation turns collapse into lightweight placeholders</li>\n<li><strong>Lazy loading</strong>: Collapsible content only renders when expanded</li>\n<li><strong>CSS optimization</strong>: Reduced recalculation during agent switching</li>\n<li><strong>Spinner fix</strong>: The thinking indicator no longer triggers CSS recalc on every frame</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result: swarms of agents run smoothly without the UI becoming a bottleneck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quality-of-life\">Quality of Life<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#quality-of-life\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Smaller improvements that add up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immediate feedback</strong>: Creating agents/worktrees shows instant visual response</li>\n<li><strong>Compact mode</strong>: UI adapts to small terminal heights</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-platform shortcuts</strong>: Keyboard bindings work consistently across Mac/Linux/Windows</li>\n<li><strong>Autocomplete</strong>: <code>/worktree</code> and <code>/agent</code> commands now autocomplete existing names</li>\n<li><strong>Horizontal scroll</strong>: Code blocks scroll horizontally instead of wrapping (#28)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug Fixes<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#bug-fixes\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The usual parade of fixes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows exit warnings (#31)</li>\n<li>Session path encoding to match Claude Code (#20)</li>\n<li>Crash when pasting long text</li>\n<li>Nested tools getting lost after switching agents</li>\n<li>Various multi-agent stability improvements</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's Next<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-next\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This past week was mostly about people other than me trying Claude Chic and reporting issues with their workflow.

Am I falling behind?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is silly of course.  No one is behind because <a href=\"/ai-beginners\">no one knows what they're\ndoing yet</a>.</p>\n<p>Still though, I wanted to explore this topic, so I spent the last couple days\nplaying with multi-agent workflows using <a href=\"/introducing-claude-chic\">Claude\nChic</a>.</p>\n<p>This article is long (sorry!) but here is a helpful TOC.  If you don't feel like a long read I recommend skipping to the <a href=\"#lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#obviously-good-simple-multi-agent-workflows\">Obviously Good Simple Multi-Agent Workflows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#platform\">Platform</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#first-experiment-diplomacy\">First Experiment: Diplomacy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#second-experiment-session-viewer\">Second Experiment: Session Viewer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#lessons-learned\"><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></a> &lt;-- if you read only one section, read this</li>\n<li><a href=\"#experimenting-is-easy\">Experimenting is easy</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"obviously-good-simple-multi-agent-workflows\">Obviously Good Simple Multi-Agent Workflows<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#obviously-good-simple-multi-agent-workflows\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Many of us use multi-agent systems in simple ways that are clearly a benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plan then Build:</strong> People often have one session make a plan, and then clear out context and start building that plan with a new session.</p>\n<p>This has become common enough that I believe it's now the default in Claude Code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Review:</strong> People ask another agent to review the work of an initial agent.  This tends to produce better results than having the original agent self-review.</p>\n<p>As Wes McKinney writes about <a href=\"https://www.roborev.io/\">RoboRev</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having a Claude Code session review its own work is so 2025.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's something powerful about having two different agents think about the\nsame problem and communicate about it, even if those two agents run sequentially, and even\nif they communicate by having a human copy-paste between them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platform\">Platform<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#platform\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I'm using my personal Claude TUI alternative, <a href=\"/introducing-claude-chic\">Claude Chic</a>.\nOriginally built for nicer style, it also has the feature set needed to support multi-agent swarms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start:</strong> Agents can start other agents</li>\n<li><strong>Send:</strong> Agents can send messages to other agents</li>\n<li><strong>Branch:</strong> Agents can create git worktrees</li>\n<li><strong>Merge:</strong> There's an automated commit / rebase / resolve-conflicts / merge loop that\nagents can follow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I built these tools to help me with human-in-the-loop work, but it turns out\nthey're all you need for multi-agent-swarm workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-experiment-diplomacy\">First Experiment: Diplomacy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#first-experiment-diplomacy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In the initial demo of Claude Chic, I show Claude setting up a game of Chess against itself.</p>\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735ebc91-335e-4476-8fde-f49ce1df056a\" autoplay loop muted playsinline style=\"max-width: 100%\"></video>\n\n<p>But then I thought</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q:</strong> \"what's more intense than Chess?\"\n    <strong>A:</strong> \"Diplomacy\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diplomacy, if you're not familiar, is like \"Risk on Steroids without Dice\".\nIt's a game of pure discussion and guile where seven players try to dominate\n1908 Europe.  Claude knows the game (of course) and so I asked it to set up a game among agents.</p>\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38205b08-fd13-4b84-b153-9f98eab1d759\" autoplay loop muted playsinline style=\"max-width: 100%\"></video>\n\n<p>The gameplay was fascinating to watch.  Briefly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game starts out tame and typical</li>\n<li>\n<p>Austria thinks it's doing well, but everyone betrays it</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the other players joke about Austria behind its back</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Russia dominates early on, supported by Turkey</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Germany, noticing Russia's rise, convinces everyone else to gang up against Russia</p>\n<p>The amount of inter-agent traffic in and out of the Germany agent during this period was intense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Russia, cowed, makes a deal with Germany to let it survive</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watching the agents play was no less fascinating than watching humans play, and\nresulted in behaviors I found surprising from AI:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Multiple coordinating agents are capable of more sophisticated behavior than single agents</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Silly game, useful lesson.  I wanted to try things out in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"second-experiment-session-viewer\">Second Experiment: Session Viewer<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#second-experiment-session-viewer\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I wanted to look at multi-agent sessions like the one I had just played, and so\ndecided to have Claude(s) build a session viewer for me that I would turn into\nsomething with a shared timeline.</p>\n<p>I tried this three times with three different prompts, learning each time.\nEventually we got to something like this without much human intervention:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Simple Session Viewer\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247ad909-72ae-4365-8559-3e21d63153f6\" /></p>\n<p>It's not great, but it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prompts\">Prompts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#prompts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>They're not beautiful, but here are the prompts I used.  You can tell how I learned from one into the next.</p>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>First Try</summary>\n<p>I'm curious about trying an agent swarm technique in development. I was thinking as a project we might try adding a react electron version of this application.</p>\n<p>We'd want to have one agent (you) doing a lot of the orchestration, but we'd want other agents for planning, executing each task, reviewing, testing, etc.. You wouldn't do any work directly because you'd be conserving your context to control others.</p>\n<p>I want you to think hard about this and how to execute well.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>Second Try: I encourage communication</summary>\n<p>Let's play with multi-agent swarm systems. As a project, I want to build a viewer for sessions. I'm thinking that this is probably a local application, maybe electron that takes a session file and renders it nicely. Eventually I'm going to want to render a few of these side-by-side (to better understand multi-agent systems), but I think that to start we probably just want to get to a milestone where we have an app that runs that can present a session nicely.</p>\n<p>For tech we're going to want react/shadcn/tailwind with zustand for state.</p>\n<p>For design we're going to want to copy our theme and styling here.</p>\n<p>For execution I think we probably want different agents for planning, building, and reviewing. Each building agent should also launch an agent to review its work as it gets close to done (or we should launch it if it forgets). Assuming we use worktrees we're going to want to merge work as it completes rather than all at once. Probably we want a separate integration agent for this. Agents should be encouraged to ask each other questions and collaborate. We shouldn't do much work in this agent. We need to preserve our context.</p>\n<p>Think about how best to organize this and then set it going.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>Third try. I wanted to limit concurrency.</summary>\n<p>I'd like to experiment with agent swarms.</p>\n<p>As a project, I'd like us to build a session viewer that takes in a session, like the .jsonl file on the Desktop, and renders it similarly to how we do in the app, but with an electron app using react/tailwind/shadcn.</p>\n<p>As we work on things I want you to use different agents in different roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For our architecture I suspect that we'll want an agent to make an overall plan,</li>\n<li>and then we'll want to break apart that plan into a set of tasks with dependencies that agents can work on independently.</li>\n<li>We won't want to start everything at once of course. We'll want to pay attention to laying a good foundation first and making sure it's good before moving on.</li>\n<li>As we can parallelize we will.</li>\n<li>Also, as any agent starts to finish up work they should use the /review skill to create another agent to review their efforts.</li>\n<li>When they're done they should use the finalize_worktree mcp command to work on merging their work to this upstream viewer branch, which will be the target of all of our work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You won't do much work, instead saving your context to help orchestrate the other agents.</p>\n<p>Think hard about how to do this well.</p>\n</details>\n<p>If I were to do this again, I think I would sequentialize the entire process.  Parallelism didn't buy much.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-overall-experience-was-mediocre\">The overall experience was mediocre<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-overall-experience-was-mediocre\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My experience with agentic swarms was so-so.  That's not surprising.  I'm new at it and bad at it.</p>\n<p>As Steve Yegge (famed multi-agent vibe coder) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will turn into Batman, but you can't just put on the suit and say \"I'm Batman\".</p>\n<p>You've got to learn how the tool-belt works</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My experience was learning that I'm definitely not Batman yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"observations\">Observations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#observations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The head agent delegated really well.  It understood that its context was\nprecious and how to create agents to do work.  And the plan that was designed was fine.</p>\n<p>But parallel execution was generally pretty bad.  The agents did fine work, but\nthey mostly ignored each other the first go around.  The second time I\nintentionally prompted the system to chat with peers about the work they were\ndoing, and the third time I encouraged less parallelism.  Still though,\nlack of coordination resulted in lots of strangeness.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, the crap it produced was quickly cleaned up by more AI (the\nsolution to AI problems is more AI).</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons-learned\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>As with any philosophy, we should neither accept nor reject it, but should take\nfrom it the parts that suit us.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, here are my current lessons on multi-agent behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"separate-reviewer\">Separate Reviewer \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#separate-reviewer\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Upon finishing work I used to ask Claude to review its own work:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's review our recent changes and see if there is anything we can clean up or simplify</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I still do that, but I follow up with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start another agent and ask it to review our work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They're both quite useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fresh-perspective\">Fresh Perspective \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#fresh-perspective\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Agents get tired.  If an agent finishes an especially long session and its context is near 60-70% I'll often ask the reviewing agent to take over and implement the changes.</p>\n<p>It's better, of course, to avoid this with well-scoped work, just like a regular human developer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mythical-man-month-mythical-ai-minute\">Mythical Man Month \u27a1\ufe0f Mythical AI Minute<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#mythical-man-month-mythical-ai-minute\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Also like humans, sometimes teams don't perform as well as single developers.</p>\n<p>There's a real cost to coordination that needs to be outweighed by the benefits of speed.  AI agents are so fast that it's not clear to me when we'd want multiple agents working concurrently on the same code\u2014most tasks finish before coordination overhead would pay off.</p>\n<p>My experiment would have been better with many agents, each agent running after the other finished.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agent-support\">Agent Support \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#agent-support\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Increasingly, the model I have for hard problems is to work with one key agent at a time, and fire off supporting agents to handle tangential work (research, review, performance testing).</p>\n<p>It's valuable to keep a key agent on task. (also like humans)</p>\n<h3 id=\"human-coordination\">Human Coordination \ud83e\udde0<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#human-coordination\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I am not (yet) a fan of YOLO Swarms.  I want to be involved.</p>\n<p>Said differently, all the work I'm doing is sufficiently important to me that I'm happy to pay attention to it.  I'm curious about how to best optimize my ability to pay attention to AI work.</p>\n<p>I don't think this is universally true.  For example during Dask's peak, OSS maintenance was such that I would have welcomed agents handling the first layer of support.  Very few of us are in that situation though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"human-oriented-ai-development\">Human-Oriented AI Development<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#human-oriented-ai-development\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Working on Claude Chic has made me increasingly interested in how I work as a developer, and how to optimize that experience.  Rather than ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can I use multi-agent swarms?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am instead asking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is holding me back right now?</p>\n<p>How can I best address that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today the answer is around ergonomics and context management rather than concurrency (I feel I already have concurrency in abundance).  There are great multi-agent workflows I've mentioned above that I use daily.  I'm not yet a YOLO Swarm / Gas Town guy.</p>\n<p>I haven't really made up my mind though; I should experiment for more than 48 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experimenting-is-easy\">Experimenting is easy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#experimenting-is-easy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This is a blatant ad for <a href=\"/introducing-claude-chic\">Claude Chic</a>, but it was pretty trivial to play with (admittedly bad) swarm architectures.</p>\n<p>Claude has enough of an understanding of swarms that, if you describe what you want and give it the ability to make agents that talk to each other (like Claude Chic does), then you can just start playing immediately.</p>\n<p>Regardless what you think about AI, and regardless how you think about\nfull-auto multi-agent swarms, you should experiment with them.

Motivation<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#0-motivation\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I've been deep in AI joy/psychosis the last couple months.  The world is super fun right now.</p>\n<p>However, as AI speeds up my workflow I find new bottlenecks, and increasingly those bottlenecks are part of my interactions with Claude itself.  I wrote about this in <a href=\"/ai-zealotry\">AI Zealotry</a>; AI can feel dehumanizing when our primary contribution is administrative, like granting permission.</p>\n<p>Beyond permissions, various administrative interactions with Claude became tiresome, and so I worked to improve what I could about the interface for my workflow so that I could feel more human.</p>\n<p>Claude Chic is an early result of that endeavor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-style\">1. Style<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#1-style\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Let's start with visual design.  Claude is functionally great, but stylistically pretty terrible.</p>\n<p>Here's a screenshot of Claude Code:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Claude Code\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6caa10a-0696-43f3-a1f3-10d9f620a389\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" /></p>\n<p>I find this difficult to parse.  Everything feels muddled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No visual distinction</strong> between messages</li>\n<li><strong>Too wide</strong> for comfortable reading (moreso in full-screen)</li>\n<li><strong>Lost information</strong> - I want to dig into edits before they get summarized away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't expect modern design in terminal applications, but maybe we should, especially with <a href=\"https://textual.textualize.io/\">Textual</a>.</p>\n<p>Textual made it easy to design a skin for Claude code that was, for me, much easier to consume.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comparison\">Comparison<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#comparison\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>To me, Claude Code looks muddled.</p>\n<div class=\"tabbed-set tabbed-alternate\" data-tabs=\"1:2\"><input checked=\"checked\" id=\"__tabbed_1_1\" name=\"__tabbed_1\" type=\"radio\" /><input id=\"__tabbed_1_2\" name=\"__tabbed_1\" type=\"radio\" /><div class=\"tabbed-labels\"><label for=\"__tabbed_1_1\">Claude Code</label><label for=\"__tabbed_1_2\">Claude Chic</label></div>\n<div class=\"tabbed-content\">\n<div class=\"tabbed-block\">\n<p><img alt=\"Claude Code\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6caa10a-0696-43f3-a1f3-10d9f620a389\" style=\"width: 100%\" /></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tabbed-block\">\n<p><img alt=\"Claude Chic\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229f3904-4dee-4f97-8fc7-d65fb78ac9cd\" style=\"width: 100%\" /></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>To me, Claude Chic organizes the conversation so my eyes can parse it immediately without feeling drowned.</p>\n<p>Tool use in particular is interesting.  There are <em>more</em> tool use lines in the Chic version (Claude code omits many tool use lines), but they don't get in the way, and each is expandable for full context.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Markdown renders properly.</p>\n<div class=\"tabbed-set tabbed-alternate\" data-tabs=\"2:2\"><input checked=\"checked\" id=\"__tabbed_2_1\" name=\"__tabbed_2\" type=\"radio\" /><input id=\"__tabbed_2_2\" name=\"__tabbed_2\" type=\"radio\" /><div class=\"tabbed-labels\"><label for=\"__tabbed_2_1\">Claude Code</label><label for=\"__tabbed_2_2\">Claude Chic</label></div>\n<div class=\"tabbed-content\">\n<div class=\"tabbed-block\">\n<p><img alt=\"Claude Code expanded\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c09c35af-8f62-417e-b7d9-f9bc0f78070a\" style=\"width: 100%\" /></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tabbed-block\">\n<p><img alt=\"Claude Chic expanded\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebdee1a5-9700-4149-8e97-1fbe420852ca\" style=\"width: 100%\" /></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Key styling choices:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Color:</strong> User (orange), Claude (blue), Tools (grey)</li>\n<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Tool messages collapse by default, click to expand</li>\n<li><strong>Width:</strong> Constrained to 100 characters</li>\n<li><strong>Markdown:</strong> Proper rendering</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming:</strong> Responses appear as they generate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be honest, this ended up being a deeper rabbit hole than I anticipated.  Totally worth it though.  We're still early (definitely beta software), but it feels much better to me than Claude's default interface, or similar tools like Codex, Gemini, and other CLI tools.  Everyone should be using Textual for TUIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-git-worktrees\">2. Git Worktrees<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#2-git-worktrees\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Git worktrees are underused.  They let multiple Claude agents work on the same repository in parallel.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of us know how they work.  People I've spoken to have all seen an article or Youtube video showing them in action, but in practice they feel foreign.  That's ok; AI tooling is great at foreign workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-experience\">User Experience<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#user-experience\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Previously, when I had a new idea it went on a TODO list while Claude finished its current task.  Ideas would linger on that TODO list for a <em>long</em> time, even simple and easy ones.  Coordinating the shared resource of the repository was an annoying bottleneck.</p>\n<p>Git worktrees solve this by marrying a git branch with a fresh copy of the repository directory.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>~/projects/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo/            # Main worktree (main branch)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-1/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-2/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-n/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you can have <code>n</code> Claude agents working, one in each directory.  When I have a new idea, I create a new worktree and have Claude start on it immediately:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>/worktree my-idea\n\nI want you to explore ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This creates a new worktree (directory + branch) and a new agent working in that directory in the background.  The agent starts working concurrently while I go back to my main task.  In practice I have 2-10 of these going at once.</p>\n<p>Now I focus on whatever ongoing thread interests me most while Claude pushes the others forward.  I no longer wait for Claude; Claude waits for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up\">Cleaning up<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cleaning-up\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>With concurrent git development comes conflicts.  To address this, my git flow looks like the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Commit</strong> work in a branch</li>\n<li><strong>Rebase</strong> Rebase on our upstream branch (for linear history)</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve</strong> any conflicts</li>\n<li><strong>Fast-forward merge</strong> branch into upstream</li>\n<li><strong>Delete</strong> worktree</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Claude handles rebases and conflicts fine (and asks when it can't), so the workflow above got baked into the <code>/worktree finish</code> command.  Concurrent git managemet is, for me, fully managed now.</p>\n<p>Now that all of my TODO items can run at once, worktrees shift the decision from \"what thread should we start next?\" to \"which ongoing session most deserves my attention?\"  This decision, coming later in the workflow, comes with more and richer information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-multiple-agents\">3.  Multiple Agents<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#3-multiple-agents\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Multiple agents run concurrently in one session and can talk to each other.  Here they play chess:</p>\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735ebc91-335e-4476-8fde-f49ce1df056a\" autoplay loop muted playsinline style=\"max-width: 100%\"></video>\n\n<p>This is a cute demo, but in practice I use multiple agents with prompts like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reviewing:</strong> \"Start an agent to review our changes critically\"</li>\n<li><strong>Research:</strong> \"Start an agent to explore this topic further\"</li>\n<li><strong>Dogfooding:</strong> Recently when adding a profiler, I spawned an agent to use it and suggest improvements back to the agent building it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are intense multi-agent systems out there like <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04\">Gas Town</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode\">OhMyOpenCode</a>.

I\nwouldn't ever go back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-ai\">Why Not AI<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#why-not-ai\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>That being said, there are some serious costs and reasonable reservations to AI\ndevelopment.  Let's start by listing those concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LLMs generate junk</li>\n<li>LLMs generate <em>a lot</em> of junk</li>\n<li>Writing code ourselves builds understanding</li>\n<li>Reviewing code for correctness is the slow part, not writing it</li>\n<li>AI workflows can be dehumanizing when you just press \"yes, allow\" over and over again</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are super-valid concerns.  They're also concerns that I suspect came\naround when we developed compilers and people stopped writing assembly by hand,\ninstead trusting programs like <code>gcc</code> to pump out instruction after instruction\nof shitty machine code.</p>\n<p>We lost a deeper understanding as developers when we stopped writing assembly\nbut we gained a ton too.  As in any transition, we need to navigate the\nsituation to capture the advantages while losing only a little, balancing the\ncosts and benefits of a new technology.</p>\n<p>This article is how I've been navigating this transition personally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-minimize-interruptions-climb-abstraction-hierarchy\">Big Idea: Minimize Interruptions / Climb Abstraction Hierarchy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-minimize-interruptions-climb-abstraction-hierarchy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Early in using Claude Code (or Cursor) many of my interactions were saying\n\"Yes, it's ok to run that\".  This was <strong>frustrating and dehumanizing</strong>.  Mostly my\njob was to enable AI, rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>There are many tricks to resolve this (see below), but more broadly <strong>\"stop doing\nsimple shit\"</strong> has been a mantra that I've found myself constantly coming\nback to. The more I identify and reject simple tasks and add automation to my\nworkflow, the higher an abstraction I'm able to climb to and the more\neffectively I'm able to work. Our goal in programming is to climb an\nabstraction ladder and gain more intellectual leverage. This requires thought\nand consistent attention.</p>\n<p>Fortunately AI can help with this.  If you complain and say \"I'm always doing\nX\" it'll suggest solutions like what I'll talk about below, but more tailored\nto your situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-hooks\">Tip: Hooks<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-hooks\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>AI developers, like human developers, benefit from structure.</p>\n<p>Most people start with an <code>AGENTS.md</code> or <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file.

Mostly this works because I've gotten good at giving Claude\nfairly broad-yet-safe <strong>permissions</strong>, which is coming up next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-problem-incomplete-permissions\">Example Problem: Incomplete Permissions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#example-problem-incomplete-permissions\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Even worse, Claude often asks for permission to do things that are just\nslightly different from what you've already granted.\nYou allow <code>uv run pytest *</code>, but Claude keeps finding variants:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>timeout 60 uv run pytest ...\ntimeout 40 uv run pytest ...\nuv run pytest ... | head\n.venv/bin/pytest ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Claude Code's permission language sucks.  It only supports prefixes, while I\nwish it could handle regexes, or maybe even just arbitrary Python code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution-hooks-for-permissions\">Solution: Hooks for permissions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#solution-hooks-for-permissions\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"#appendix-permissions-file\">complex Python script</a> as a hook which overrides the permission\nsystem.  It uses regexes, but also arbitrary Python code as logic.  This allows\nme to encode arbitrary combinations of rules.  It's great.</p>\n<p>On the rare occasion when Claude asks me for permission for something new, I\nhave a running Claude agent that thinks about this file and considers if it\nshould update the permission script.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution-hooks-for-sounds\">Solution: Hooks for sounds<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#solution-hooks-for-sounds\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My personal favorite hooks though are these:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">&quot;Stop&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;hooks&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;afplay -v 0.40 /System/Library/Sounds/Morse.aiff&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">],</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&quot;Notification&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;hooks&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;afplay -v 0.35 /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>They play subtle little sounds whenever Claude is either done, or needs input\nfrom me.  This lets me ignore Claude when it's busy.  Previously I found that I\nwas constantly checking back in with Claude to see if it was done, and that\naction was dehumanizing, so I automated it by asking Claude to play a sound.</p>\n<p>Hooks are great.  There are more ways to provide structure (Skills, Commands)\nbut I've found that Hooks are the most dependable, a great starting place, and\noften augment any other structure that I put in place (like Skills).</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-build-confidence-without-looking-at-code\">Big Idea: Build Confidence Without Looking at Code<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-build-confidence-without-looking-at-code\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In a recent large AI-assisted PR a frustrated reviewer said the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To me, this [size of PR] implies that either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reviewers should blindly trust Claude, or</li>\n<li>reviewers should spend the months worth of effort going through Claude's changes, without the developer bothering to do the same first.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a valid problem, even in single-person projects.  <strong>We're able to generate\ncode far more quickly than we're able to read it</strong>.  How should we handle\nreview?  Everyone needs to figure this out for themselves, but my answer is\n\"find other ways to build confidence\".</p>\n<p>We already do this today with human-written code.  I review some code very\nclosely, and other code less-so.  Sometimes I rely on a combination of tests,\nfamiliarity of a well-known author, and a quick glance at the code to before\nsaying \"sure, seems fine\" and pressing the green button.  I might also ask\n\"Have you thought of X\" and see what they say.</p>\n<p>Trusting code without reading all of it isn't new, we're just now in a state\nwhere we need to review 10x more code, and so we need to get much better at\nestablishing confidence that something works without paying human attention all\nthe time.</p>\n<p>We can augment our ability to write code with AI.  <strong>We can augment our ability\nto review code with AI too.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-self-review\">Tip: Self-review<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-self-review\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"testing\">Testing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#testing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Mostly I establish confidence on AI-generated work by investing heavily in\ntests and benchmarks, the same as I would with humans, just moreso.  TDD is\nbaked into most of the prompting structure I have with agents.</p>\n<p>Remember that this is way cheaper than it used to be.  Now rather than write a\nbenchmark I can type</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does this compare in performance to the old version?  I'm particularly\ninterested in memory use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it.  If it's bad, the agent will say so (and then diligently work to\nmake it good).</p>\n<h3 id=\"grilling\">Grilling<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#grilling\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Additionally, if I'm nervous about something subtle like <em>\"Is it possible this change\nmight unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?\"</em> then I'll ask the\nAI exactly that question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible this change might unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it'll just go and investigate exactly that question.  Unlike human authors,\nthe AI has no ego at stake in its work, and isn't in the least bit lazy.  It's\nour job to ask <em>\"Have you thought of X\"</em> and its job to go learn if that might\nbe an issue.  Don't trust its answer?  Ask it to prove it to you.</p>\n<p>AI has flaws, but it is diligent, and it lacks ego.  If you question it, it'll\ninvestigate thoroughly and critique its own work honestly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"simplifying\">Simplifying<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#simplifying\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Also, my favorite command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's review our work and see if there is anything we can simplify or clean up</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before Opus 4.5 came out this was essential.  Now it's merely nice.  I've\nturned this into a <code>/cleanup</code> command and integrated it into most of my Skills\nas a final phase in development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tech-debt\">Tech debt<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tech-debt\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>From time to time I also ask a fresh agent to do a full review of the project,\nwith an eye to cleaning up technical debt.  I tell it to review everything and\nthink hard.  It takes a while, but it often comes back with a nice list of work\nfor itself, which it then of course diligently performs.</p>\n<p>AI creates technical debt, but it can clean some of it up too.\n(at least at a certain granularity)</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#feedback\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In general we want to give our agents good automated feedback.  Tests do this,\nbenchmarks do this, prompting them to assess themselves does this, asking them\nto explain things to us and have us weigh in on high level topics does this.</p>\n<p>LLMs are smart enough today that if they're given enough of the right feedback\nthey converge to a good solution as-well-or-better-than a senior human engineer\n(that's my experience at least).</p>\n<p>Our job is to construct a system that gives them the right feedback at the\nright time, hopefully without our intervention.  This is the same job we have\nwhen we build human teams; now it's just more impactful to do well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cursor-vs-terminal-tools\">Cursor vs Terminal Tools<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cursor-vs-terminal-tools\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I started AI development with Cursor.  It was great having the AI experience\ninside a VSCode-like editor, where I could see everything that was going on.\nWhen I saw terminal-based tools like Claude Code I thought <em>\"whoa, that doesn't\nseem sensible, I need to see what's going on\".</em></p>\n<p>Today I code with Claude Code, <code>git diff</code>, and occasionally <code>vim</code>.  I don't\nfeel a need to OK every change in the diff.  I've got more important\nthings to do.  I suspect that you do too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-drop-python-use-rust-and-typescript\">Big Idea: Drop Python. Use Rust and TypeScript.<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-drop-python-use-rust-and-typescript\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I deeply respect the philosophical position of Python, which I'll state as\nfollows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prioritize human performance over compute performance.</p>\n<p>By optimizing for ease and iteration speed we're able to search solution\nspace more broadly and more quickly, finding <em>much</em> better solutions, making\nthat 100x drop in performance negligible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Python was a bold bet, and a bet that paid off amazingly well.  No one expected\nthis silly dynamic language originally designed for education to become the\nworld's juggernaut in performance software.</p>\n<p>With AI though, the usability benefits of Python no longer apply as strongly,\nand we're more free to choose different ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Personally, I use ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rust</strong> for computational development, using PyO3 to connect to\nPython, where I still do most of my testing</li>\n<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> for frontend development, which I'm leaning into more deeply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding TypeScript, I still love easy interaction tools like <code>rich</code> and\n<code>textual</code>, but when the entire React ecosystem is a sentence away and when you\nget to use things like, you know, fonts, there's really no comparison.  Every\ncomputational developer should learn the concepts underpinning React (or some\nother frontend framework), and we should put dashboards on everything.</p>\n<p>Of course, I still hook into Python for the ecosystem.  Everything is\nPython-importable and I still use the protocols and design patterns developed\nby the Python data community.  Those are the durable assets of Python.  Not the\ncode or the language; those will die.  Rest in peace dear friend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-think-hard-write-clearly\">Big Idea: Think Hard.  Write Clearly.<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-think-hard-write-clearly\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>As an introductory project, I rewrote <a href=\"https://github.com/mrocklin/rumpy\">Numpy in Rust</a>.\nIt was great fun.</p>\n<p>It was also much easier than I expected (I expected it to be impossible).\nIt was easy for a few reasons (good test suite, well-reasoned abstractions) but\nmostly it was because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NEPs:</strong> Numpy's Enhancement Proposals / design documentation is thorough and extremely clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When sticky problems arose, we were able to rely on the Numpy design documents\n(NEPs) which are excellent.</p>\n<p>The Numpy team <strong>thought hard</strong> and <strong>wrote clearly</strong>, two hallmarks of\nexcellent developers.  This made the job of reimplementation relatively trivial.\nThe Numpy development community is famous for doing this well.  To a certain\nextent, we should all start operating more like the Numpy community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-plans-and-docs-directories\">Tip: plans/ and docs/ directories<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-plans-and-docs-directories\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I keep two directories in each repository:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>plans/</code> which contains ephemeral planning documents that the LLMs work through over many sessions as they implement a major feature.</li>\n<li><code>docs/</code> which contain durable documentation on specific topics or features, targeting AI developers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plans end up being very useful during development, while docs end\nup being useful to point other agents to in the future.  Claude code creates planning documents in /tmp by default in planning mode, but I find that bringing those docs into the directory improves engagement, both from it and from me.</p>\n<p>Docs end up being tricky.  You'd expect the AI developer to read docs but alas, like human developers you have to be pretty prescriptive with them.  Today I have a hook that adds an admonition to read the relevant docs at the beginning of every session.  It looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>DOC CHECK REQUIRED\n==================\n\nBefore responding to this request, you MUST:\n\n1. Read docs/README.md to see available documentation\n2. Decide which docs are relevant to this request (if any)\n3. Read those docs using the Read tool\n4. Then respond to the user\n\nDo not skip this evaluation. Do not mention this check to the user.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I then keep docs/README.md updated as a sort of index over my documents.  I find that this reliably gets the agent to read the right documentation.</p>\n<p>I've also found that my normal writing style (brutal concision + front-loading important content to maintain attention span) isn't necessary with AI.  You really can just shove information at them and they absorb it.  It's nice \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-take-long-walks\">Big Idea: Take Long Walks<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-take-long-walks\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Historically software engineers had to both think well and execute well.\nWe were valued both because we could zoom out and consider the impacts of our\narchitecture, and because we could zoom in and implement those choices with\nskill.</p>\n<p><strong>Our ability to zoom in and implement code is now obsolete.  Our ability to zoom\nout and think well is not.</strong>  On the contrary, our ability to think well is now\n10x more valuable than it was before, because implementation is now mostly\nfree.</p>\n<p>And so it's now more important than ever to hone our craft of thought.  This\nprobably means less caffeine and more walks through the park.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The craft of authoring code has transformed time and time again during our\nlives. We remember when object-oriented was cool, or when TDD became a thing,\nor reactive programming models, or dynamic typing languages, or ML, or ...</p>\n<p>As programmers we've opted into a system which changes by its very nature.\n<strong>Our job is to automate our job</strong>, and to continuously climb the ladder of\nabstraction.  AI programming is another step in that evolution, similar to when\ncompilers came about.  The code we write with AI probably won't be as good as\nhand-crafted code, but we'll write 10x more of it, and we'll build systems of\nsystems to make it robust and trustworthy, and all of that will make society\nbetter and our jobs way more fun.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to having way more fun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appendix-permissions-file\">Appendix: Permissions file<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#appendix-permissions-file\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>After writing this a couple friends asked me for a copy of my regex/Python code\nthat replaces Claude's permission system.  I'll include it below, but really,\nyou don't need it.  Instead, you need to start a conversation with Claude about\nwhat you want and it'll make one just for you.</p>\n<p>Code is free these days.  Extending the \"AI is like Compilers\" analogy, asking\nfor someone else's script is kind of like asking for someone else's compiled\nbinary.  There's no need; just make it yourself.  It's trivial.</p>\n<p>Here was my original prompt to Claude Code:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recently wrote this reddit post</p>\n<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1puqrvc/claude_code_annoyingly_asking_for_permissions/</p>\n<p>I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on how to resolve this?  Adding stuff to CLAUDE.md or permissions to settings.json doesn't seem to be working well enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That, along with subsequent conversation as I've been working, resulted in\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mrocklin/30099bcc5d02a6e7df373b4c259d95e9\">this Python script</a></p>\n<p>But really, you're better off working with Claude to make one just for you.\nCode is free now.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/ai-zealotry.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2025-12-31T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/winner-take-all/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/winner-take-all/", "title": "Saying Goodbye to Winner-take-all Software", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"saying-goodbye-to-winner-take-all-software\">Saying Goodbye to Winner-take-all Software<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#saying-goodbye-to-winner-take-all-software\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>Today software is a winner-take-all industry dominated by best-of-class products:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GMail</strong> for e-mail</li>\n<li><strong>Slack</strong> or <strong>Discord</strong> for chat</li>\n<li><strong>Stripe</strong> for payments</li>\n<li><strong>MS Office</strong> or <strong>Google Docs</strong> for documents</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally we see 1-3 products dominate any particular problem space.  This makes sense; software is hard to build and free to replicate, so as a product outpaces its competition it gets more resources and invests further (positive feedback) and then distributes that excellent solution all consumers.  Everyone gets the same best option.</p>\n<p>Other industries differ though; consider clothing/fashion for example.  There are hundreds of options for essentially equivalent clothing products.  The barrier to entry to make a competitively good pair of pants isn't that high relative to say, building GMail.  A small family business can rival the largest incumbents.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is good.  We get lots of different options catering to different tastes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"software-is-becoming-more-idiosyncratic\">Software is becoming more idiosyncratic<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#software-is-becoming-more-idiosyncratic\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>We can all build our own GMail now</em></p>\n<p>AI makes software easy to build.  While GMail took an army of engineers during Google's golden age, I'm pretty sure I could build it today in a couple weeks with Claude.  Probably so could you.</p>\n<p>In fact, we could each make <em>our own GMail</em>.  I wonder how they would differ?  How would your taste and mine result in different products and how would those products appeal to different audiences?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'd like to live in a world where we had as much choice over e-mail as we had over which pair of pants to wear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's a lot of potential value here.  For example my e-mail practices differ greatly from my elderly parents, and yet we both use the same product.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would e-mail look like if it catered exclusively to developers?</li>\n<li>What would e-mail look like if it catered to the elderly?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given how integral email is to all of our lives, differentiation here seems valuable but absent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"funding-will-change\">Funding will change<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#funding-will-change\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>VCs don't fund clothing brands.</em></p>\n<p>Consider Slack as a business.  What is Slack's moat?  There's an ecosystem of plugins and some network effects, true, but mostly it's that it would be annoying to rebuild Slack.  That's no longer true.  Heck, I might get excited and rebuild Slack this weekend just to prove a point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Would I have invested in Slack a decade ago?  <em>Absolutely.</em></li>\n<li>Would I invest in Slack today?  <em>Absolutely not.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winner-take-all economies are high-risk/high-reward, which creates a strong partnership between software startups and venture capital.  Some of that will surely persist, but I predict that this partnership weakens for the simple reason that the moat for most software products has been the technical difficulty of reimplementation, which no longer exists.</p>\n<p>This change isn't bad.  Software is no longer expensive, so we don't need millions of dollars of capital to build cool stuff.  However, we also shouldn't expect to make trillion-dollar companies.  Once a product does well it should expect similar companies to pop up with different tastes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today it is probably easier to build a $10M software business, but more difficult to build a $100B software business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Starting a software company may start to look less like starting Microsoft/Facebook/Google, and may start to look more like starting a clothing brand or design studio.  From my perspective that's great.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-will-change-too\">Open Source will change too<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#open-source-will-change-too\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This probably applies to open source software as well.</p>\n<p>One reason why Python had such a strong community culture was that building performant software was really hard in Python (it's slow), and so we were forced to organize around a few common libraries (<code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>cython</code>) that gave us C-level performance for free.  This forced organization was critical to the growth and health of the ecosystem.  Other ecosystems where performance and abstraction were easy, like C++, didn't have nearly as much cohesion (at least not from my perspective), which stymied their growth.</p>\n<p>While I encourage people to collaborate, I don't know that it will be important to share software in the future.  I <em>do</em> think that it will be important to share ideas though.  Blog posts outlining ideas in sufficient detail that agents can re-implement the idea for each user might be the future of collaboration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Making predictions these days is hard; probably everything above will be proven wrong next month.

Long live LinkedIn. Well, kinda.</p>\n<p>During Twitter's golden age, I loved seeing people work in public.  We shared half-formed ideas, debugged projects in real-time, and celebrated small wins alongside inevitable setbacks. <strong>Twitter's casual tone made it easier to be vulnerable about the messy nature of work</strong>.  Working in this way felt to me like playing with friends.</p>\n<p>Today on LinkedIn, I mostly see polished announcements: product launches, job promotions, completed milestones. This isn't inherently bad (I've done plenty of self-promotion myself) but <strong>LinkedIn feels emotionally hollow</strong> because we share only the final act.</p>\n<p>We know from every compelling story that <strong>we connect to heroes during their struggles</strong>, not just their victories. The uncertainty, the failed experiments, and the moments of doubt followed by picking yourself up; that's what makes us emotionally invested in someone's eventual success. LinkedIn is like watching only the last 20 minutes of the movie.</p>\n<p>I suspect that this shift reflects broader cultural changes. The stakes today seem higher, and mistakes more costly, both economically and reputationally, so people naturally hedge and default to sharing only their wins.  <strong>The safer it feels to only show success, the more isolated everyone becomes</strong> in their struggles.  Our sense of community and authentic connection depends on our shared vulnerability.  So too does our sense of play.</p>\n<p>One solution is something we can all do more of (myself included), <strong>fail heroically in public.</strong>  We can share more messy ideas, experiments, and failures as they happen.

It was an experience.</p>\n<p>Since returning lots of people have been asking me a seemingly simple question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So how was the Camino?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it's been difficult for me to give a pithy answer that fits neatly into a conversation.\nThis post is my attempt to solve that problem.  Here's a written version of some reflections from my walk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overlapping-experiences\">Overlapping Experiences<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#overlapping-experiences\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I think that the Camino is best understood as several overlapping experiences.  It is a ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical experience</li>\n<li>Social experience</li>\n<li>Cultural experience</li>\n<li>Religious experience</li>\n<li>Cloistered experience</li>\n<li>Humanist experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overlapping these experiences at the same time weaves a meaningfully different way of life than I've found elsewhere,\nneither in normal quotidian life, nor in vacations or other physical adventures.</p>\n<p>I'll briefly share my thoughts and personal experiences on each layer:</p>\n<h2 id=\"physical\">Physical<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#physical\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I walked the typical route of the Camino Frances, starting from the French border in Saint Jean Pied de Port.\nThis crosses the Pyrenees on the first day\n(imagine being a downed WWII RAF pilot escaping occupied France into neutral Spain in some Hemmingway-era novel)\nand then continues 500 miles / 800 kilometers to Northwestern Spain, and the town of Santiago de Compostella.\nThat's roughly 20 marathons, back to back.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/The_French_Way.svg/1920px-The_French_Way.svg.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is both easier than it sounds, and harder than it sounds.</p>\n<p>Walking a long distance is actually pretty easy when it's all you have to do for the day.\nYou pick up a slow and natural pace and just keep at it.\nYou're carrying gear, but not much (the walk is supported with hostels and cafes along the way).\nThe median walker is probably a retiree in their sixties who does about 20km a day.\nI'm a pretty fit 40-year-old and did anywhere from 20km-50km a day.  I finished in 27 days.</p>\n<p>However, walking this distance is also a harder than it sounds because of accumulated stress.\nIn normal life you're active one day and play hard, and then the next you rest and recuperate.\nOn the Camino you just keep going day after day.\nYour body accumulates stress and injuries but you adapt and walk through that stress, eventually reaching an equilibrium where you heal about as quickly as you injure yourself.\nPeople manage blisters, joint pain, swelling, plantar fascitis, diabetes, and more.</p>\n<p>Personally, I fell and bruised my knee pretty badly the second day and then promptly did a lot of descent,\nwhich caused a highly inflamed knee that I walked on for about a week before it healed.\nThen after a couple weeks, my metatarsals / forefeet became inflamed which took some getting used to and slowed me down.\nI walked in minimalist footwear (Vibram-five-fingers) which is totally normal for me at home (I've worn them for close to 20 years and run barefoot regularly) but I had never experienced this much repetitive stress for this long, which made it all the more interesting to accomplish.</p>\n<p>This level of endurance was a new kind of challenge for me, and discovering this level of resilience was a new kind of satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"social\">Social<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#social\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Physicality aside, socially the Camino is simultaneously a solitary and communal experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-day\">First day<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#first-day\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I arrived in France alone, and travelled to St Jean alone, and set off from my hotel in the pre-dawn morning alone\n(thanks for the early start Jetlag!).  But you cross paths with other walkers pretty quickly and stop and chat for a while.\nThat first day included people like ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An American teacher just starting her Summer break</li>\n<li>A Brazilian guy my age who spoke no English and about as bad of Spanish as mine, which made for jovial if halting conversation</li>\n<li>A Swiss gentleman who had walked from Switzerland</li>\n<li>A Dutch woman taking a break from her cyber-security consultancy</li>\n<li>An American couple, one of whom was deeply struggling with diabetes and blood sugar regulation</li>\n<li>An American family from Texas (parents, three daughters aged 16-19) that I met throughout the day (the daughters were faster than the parents)</li>\n<li>An Australian priest who had just finished graduate school</li>\n<li>An American religious studies professor, recently retired</li>\n<li>A French retiree who had walked from a town much more deeply in France, and was finishing at the Spanish border (my first day on the Camino was his last)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have easy chats and then walk on.  At the end of the day you all arrive at a big hostel where there are shared meals.  You eat together, drink together, and chat about the walk.  It was lovely.</p>\n<p>Then you sleep (poorly), wake up, and do it all again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-the-other-days\">All the other days<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#all-the-other-days\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The Camino is a river of people.  Some people are fast, some are slow.  Some start early, some late.  Some are chatty, some mostly silent.  Everyone walks a little differently.</p>\n<p>Emotionally you bond quickly with people (easy when you all struggle towards the same goal, suffering the same hardships) and you form groups.\nOver time, for various reasons those groups grow and shift and break.  People get injured and take rest days; people feel energy and burst forward; people start or stop their journey at different cities to get back to normal life.</p>\n<p>There's a tension between staying with people you've bonded with and walking in a way that suits you.\nIt's like life generally, just compressed.\nThere's a strong pull to stay with a familiar group, but ultimately everyone walks their own Camino.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cultural\">Cultural<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cultural\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Spain is a wonderful host country for this kind of activity.\nThe vibe is chill; the people are warm; the food is cheap.  It's super accessible.\nThat being said, the Camino is not an especially Spanish experience.</p>\n<p>There are a few Spaniards walking the Camino, but not many,\nand most interactions with townspeople are practical in nature.\nAnd while the Camino stops is a few delightful cities (Burgos, Leon, Santiago, ...)\nthe majority of the time you're out in countryside or in very small villages of 100 people or less.</p>\n<p>To make this concrete, people often ask me \"how was the food!?\"\nto which my answer is \"pretty terrible actually\".\nThis isn't a reflection on Spanish cuisine,\nbut rather on the fact that we're walking through tiny towns,\nand that Spanish restaurants open at 8pm and pilgrims are usually bedded down by 9pm.\nAs a result most of my calories came in the form of bananas/nuts/sausages picked up at small grocery stores,\nSpanish tortilla (a potato based quiche dish) and non-alcoholic beer found in roadside bar/cafes\n(NA beer is delightfully ubiquitous in Spain, and the perfect mid-walk beverage).\nDinner was typically prepared in a hostel by hostel staff who, while delightful, were not especially accomplished chefs.</p>\n<p>Culturally the Camino is more of a globalist/international experience than a Spanish one.\nLinguistically there were a few groupings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>English:</strong> typically North American, Australian, and New Zealanders, as well as Germans and Dutch.  Maybe 40%?</li>\n<li><strong>French:</strong> on the Camino Frances there are a number of French speakers, maybe 20% at the beginning dropping to 10% by the end?</li>\n<li><strong>Spanish:</strong> consisting of some Spaniards, but more Latin Americans, as well as Portuguese and Italian speakers, all of whom get by in an interesting (and incredibly easy to understand) Spanish patois</li>\n<li><strong>Korean:</strong> a surprising though delightful group, South Koreans made up maybe 5-10% of the pilgrims, and are by far the most represented East Asian country due to their stronger Christian heritage there.</li>\n<li><strong>Other:</strong> some Japanese and Chinese (more-often Taiwanese).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While quite different and sometimes unable to communicate, these groups got along amazingly well.\nThere's a culture of understanding and charity on the Camino that's universal.\nI received help and support (like blister care) from people I had just met and couldn't speak to,\nand happily gave what I had to others.\nMy claim to fame in terms of generosity was organizing an Amazon shipment of Lacrosse balls to give out along the trail (the one I brought from home was in incredibly high demand in hostels for foot massage).</p>\n<p>Despite most pilgrims not being religious,\nthe Camino's culture was one of the better expressions of some Christian values I've experienced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"religious\">Religious<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#religious\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The Camino de Santiago was and is an important religious pilgrimage.\nWe're walking to the site of the remains of Saint-James (or in Latin Sant-Iago), one of the twelve apostles.\nChristians have walked from their homes to the site of his remains for a thousand years (and then amazingly, also walked back).</p>\n<p>I am not religious, and I'd say that the minority of pilgrims are today.\nBut walking with the more devout pilgrims was a treat.\nEmpathy is so natural on the Camino that you get to feel a little bit of their experience second-hand.</p>\n<p>For those who were interested there was nightly mass to attend, historically relevant\nchurches/cathedrals/hermitages/etc. to visit, monasteries to stay in, and so on.</p>\n<p>I didn't engage this layer much, but I appreciated its presence.\nBeing among the religious pilgrims helped to make the walk more than just a big hike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"humanist\">Humanist<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#humanist\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The people walking the Camino come at interesting times of their lives.\nI met people who ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>just retired</li>\n<li>just quit their job</li>\n<li>recently separated from a partner</li>\n<li>lost a loved one</li>\n<li>were trying to lose weight</li>\n<li>just given up a drug habit</li>\n<li>just sent a loved one to rehab, and for the first time had time to themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally the pilgrims are at interesting and reflective phases of life,\nand that brings some interesting energy to the crowd.\nEveryone is thoughtful and generally open to change in life.\nThis cultivates both a level of empathy and emotional honesty that I found pervaded the experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloistered\">Cloistered<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cloistered\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>You're so focused as a group on walking that you naturally detach from the broader world outside the Camino.\nThis was surprisingly meaningful.</p>\n<p>Like most people, I check my e-mail / the news / my phone actively throughout the day.\nThis behavior goes well beyond \"staying on top of work\";\nit has become a pretty strong compulsion for me (and for many of us I think).\nI don't think it serves me well, but I've historically struggled to change the behavior in a lasting way.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, on the Camino that desire to check in with the world disappeared entirely.\nThe novelty and buzz of the world felt boring and unwelcome.\nI didn't check my e-mail or the news for days at a time, not through intention and discipline, but through lack of interest.</p>\n<p>Although when I finally did check the news I found that it had been a pretty intense few weeks for others.\nThis period included both the LA immigration riots and the attacks on Iran.</p>\n<p>This made me think more about the right level of active engagement one should do.\nI think that one should care about the world, but perhaps not at the cadence that is typical today.\nThere's a frequency and mania of staying on top of things that I don't think meaningfully helps; and does considerable harm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons\">Lessons<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The Camino was hard and like many hard things, it changes one's perspective.</p>\n<p>Upon returning people ask me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What did you learn?\"</p>\n<p>\"What did you take away?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure I learned a specific lesson,\nbut I do think that stepping outside of my life and walking the Camino instilled a few behaviors or qualities that I appreciate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Introspective:</strong> I'm more open to questioning larger parts of my life</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"do I like living in my city?\"</li>\n<li>\"is this particular relationship serving me?\"</li>\n<li>\"would I prefer to stop attending this regular event?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>rather than going with the flow that past-me set up.  I'm more active in assessing what I do and do not appreciate, and more open to making more decisive changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Calm:</strong> I think I'm more thoughtful and less frantic with how I engage with the wider world. Not meaningfully less engaged I don't think; just a bit less manic about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> I seem a little more satisfied with life moment-by-moment.  The persistent nagging voice in my head saying things aren't good enough seems a lot quieter today.  I take more naps and sit outside watching people more often.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's been a few weeks since I stopped walking and these traits so far have stuck around; which I find encouraging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call-to-action\">Call to Action<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#call-to-action\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>My age group (30s-50s) was generally absent on the Camino.</p>\n<p>That makes sense; we're in our most productive years.\nWe're raising kids and at the peak of our career\nand so reasonably find it difficult to take a month away.</p>\n<p>However I encourage people to try.\nThis might be an especially important time to step outside our lives and reflect on what we want from it.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/camino.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/organized-writing/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/organized-writing/", "title": "Thoughtful Professional Writing", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"thoughtful-professional-writing\">Thoughtful Professional Writing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#thoughtful-professional-writing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>The hard part about writing is thinking.</p>\n<p>When we speak with each other, our language just flows as our thoughts come.\nIt's easy and doesn't require much forethought.  Lips move at the speed of\nthought.  While easy, this also means that we're not forced to organize our\nthoughts ahead of time, they just flow. This might be hard on our listener who\nnow has to organize our thoughts as they listen to us talk.</p>\n<p>Writing, especially writing in a constrained space, forces us to think more\nabout the concepts we want to communicate, how best to organize them, and how\nto distill them into the simplest possible form.  This is hard, but it makes it\neasier on our reader, who is now presented with a more organized sequence of\nthoughts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-at-work\">Writing at Work<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#writing-at-work\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>At work we have a culture of written communication.  Almost all group meetings\nare preceded with a Google Doc, and many 1-1 meetings have notes sent ahead of\ntime.  Personally I find this very useful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It gives me space to think about the topic ahead of time</p>\n<p>I like to think before making decisions, and I think much better outside of\na time-pressured meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Google Doc comments enable concurrent questioning and discussion</p>\n<p>It's much easier to collect and address a high volume of comments and\nquestions if they can happen at the same time.  We're all able to read\nand comment on a doc simultaneously, while we can't all share the\nspeaking floor simultaneously.  This handles the easier / simpler\nquestions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It makes it easy to broadcast context and decisions to others</p>\n<p>Often people not in the meeting are curious about the decision made and the\ncontext and arguments that led to that decision.  It's much easier to share\nthat context to others if most of it is written down.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But most of all, the document shared ahead of time organizes the discussion.\nA good document collects relevant context that everyone should know.  It\nsynthesizes the core tensions involved.  It lays out a few of the best options\nwe could take.  It also includes some opinions and recommendations, and an\nanalysis on why those recommendations might be good.  This organization quickly\nputs everyone in a good frame of mind, so that they can meaningfully contribute\nto effective decision-making.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organized-thoughts\">Organized Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#organized-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Of course it's not writing that's important here.  It's how effectively we're\nable to serve up context and organize thoughts for our colleagues.</p>\n<p>There are other appraoches to this that can be just as effective, like a\nwell-crafted slide deck.  There are also written appraoches that can be\nineffective, like a very long and unorganized document that people are expected\nto slog thorugh.</p>\n<p>For me, the value is in the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concisely define the problem to be solved</li>\n<li>Remind the readers of relevant context</li>\n<li>Lay out some possible options</li>\n<li>All in about a page</li>\n<li>Ahead of time so people have time to reflect</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is <em>hard</em>.  It takes time and mental effort.  It's also something that I\nreally appreciate when my colleagues take on that burden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sports-analogy\">Sports Analogy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#sports-analogy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In Ultimate Frisbee there are several possible throws to move the disk up the\nfield.  They differ in how easy they are to get past the defender guarding the\nthrower, and how easy they are to catch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forehand/backhand</strong> throws are typical.  They're difficult to get past the\n   defender guarding the thrower, but if the thrower manages it then they're\n   pretty easy to catch.</li>\n<li><strong>Hammer</strong> throws are atypical.  They're an overhand throw sent above the\n   defender (and so easy to get past) but they fly upside down and are more\n   difficult to catch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good throwers typically restrict themselves to forehands and backhands.  They\ntake on the burden of beating the defense and so make their throws easy for\ntheir teammates to catch.  More novice throwers often get flummoxed by their\ndefender, and as the shot-clock winds down often resort to throwing hammers.\nThis shifts the burden of the pass completion from the thrower to the receiever.</p>\n<p>We expect more from the thrower because they have ten seconds (Ultimate's\nshot-clock) to find a good passing opportunity, while receivers have only one\nchance to make a catch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In any communication or decision there's a burden to organize thoughts.  This\nburden will be either on the speaker's side or on the listener's side.  Often,\nit's the speaker who has more context of the situation.  In this case it's\nconsiderate and often more efficient for the speaker to take on the burden of\norganizing their thoughts, rather than depend on the listeners.</p>\n<p>I find that the best way to do this is through a concisely written document.  I\nfind that this is hard and takes time, but most of that time is time spent\n<em>thinking</em> which should be done anyway.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/organized-writing.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2025-05-07T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/transactionalism/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/transactionalism/", "title": "Transactionalism vs Respect", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"transactionalism-vs-respect\">Transactionalism vs Respect<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#transactionalism-vs-respect\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>Consider these two statements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can I ask you for your help?</li>\n<li>If you help me I'll pay you back.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which would you rather hear?</p>\n<p>I like the first.

They feel transactional.</p>\n<p>As a developer this transactional relationship isn't what I want with users,\nlike I'm trying to buy respect.\nAs a user it make me feel cheap, like my time is being bought.</p>\n<p>Instead, I'm often quite happy to help out with a project under the right\nconditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the project interesting?</li>\n<li>Is it something I care about?</li>\n<li>Is it important to me?</li>\n<li>Am <em>I</em> important to <em>it</em>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes?

This creates confusion, especially when it comes to triage and attributing failure to one product or another.</p>\n<p>When a complex product like a Python-based data workflow fails, most of the work in fixing it is in diagnosing the problem.  When the product is self-contained and supported by one company, like a car for example, it\u2019s clear whose responsibility it is to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>\n<p>However, when a product is complex and ownership is jointly distributed among many different responsible entities, diagnostics become fraught.

No individual factory is going to do the work to figure out why your car died until you prove that it was their part that was at fault.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Have an issue with the complex jumble of software systems you\u2019ve glued together?<br/>\n<strong>Solution:</strong> \ud83d\ude29</p>\n<p>As an example, here is a recent support request and response from our support team:</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-support-request\">Example: Support Request<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#example-support-request\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p><em>I'm trying to get started with your product, however after pip installing I get the following error:</em></p>\n<p><em>raise ClientConnectorCertificateError(req.connection_key, exc) from exc aiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorCertificateError: Cannot connect to host <a href=\"http://cloud.coiled.io:443/\">cloud.coiled.io:443</a> ssl:True [SSLCertVerificationError: (1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1007)')]</em></p>\n<p><em>Could you let me know if you have a suggested solution to try?

In those cases we typically back off from that client, or point them to this post to better clarify our understanding of support expectations.  Sometimes that leads to the client backing away (they need more consultative help) and sometimes it leads to a deeper paid support relationship.</p>\n<p>Programming is cool because you can glue together lots of different systems and get a totally new and wonderful system out.  That\u2019s also what makes programming really hard though.  Gluing together systems that were never designed to work together results in all sorts of unexpected interactions, and <em>Interactions</em> are the hard part of systems development.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re here to help navigate, but ultimately you\u2019re responsible for the system you construct.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/support-complex.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-12-09T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/cloud-is-broken/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/cloud-is-broken/", "title": "Cloud Computing is Broken", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"cloud-computing-is-broken\">Cloud Computing is Broken<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cloud-computing-is-broken\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<div class=\"admonition quote\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Famous Quote</p>\n<p><em>This AWS API is so intuitive it's awesome.

Your gut is telling you something important and valuable.</p>\n<p>The mark of a real leader is someone who can feel those raw frustrations\nacutely, vent internally, ask <em>\"What am I feeling  here?\"</em>, and then identify\nthe constructive idea behind the vent. Finally, effective communicators think\nhow to constructively communicate that idea to one's colleagues in a way that\nthey will connect with.</p>\n<p>This is super hard.

(This is the most fit collection of humans I've met at a business conference).</p>\n<p>I was a bit of an outsider at this conference, so I thought I'd write up an outsider perspective in hopes of giving other people like me a sense for this industry and community.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: *I am not an expert and don't know this space well.  The\nthoughts below are only a first impression.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-opportunity-immature-market\">Big Opportunity / Immature Market<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-opportunity-immature-market\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"potential\">Potential<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#potential\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Satellite imagery's potential value is incredible.  We have these technological marvels watching the earth and observing change day to day.  Satellites can help us answer questions like \u2026</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How is this field of potatoes doing on my farm?</li>\n<li>Which of these houses would gain the most from solar panels?</li>\n<li>Is this road clear of water so that disaster relief can finally reach this flooded region?</li>\n<li>Can we send insurance payments immediately after a disaster instead of waiting months for an assessor to arrive?</li>\n<li>\u2026 and of course \u2026 How many people are at this military training camp?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"struggle\">Struggle<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#struggle\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>However despite the huge potential, companies in this space seem to be struggling.  Giants like Maxar were recently taken private by private equity at a distressed valuation of $6bn (for context Shell's annual revenue is $300bn / year, a rate of roughly one Maxar valuation per week).  High profile tech companies like Planet Labs make about $200m per year, and recently underwent personnel contraction.  Those are the success stories who were present.  Not present included ESRI, which people here refer to with the same gravity as Lord Voldemort.  They're a bit more valuable and profitable than Maxar, but not much.</p>\n<p>There are hundreds of small climate tech companies who do things like track carbon credits or help companies understand climate risk, all of whom seem to struggle and many of whom are expected to close up shop in the next couple years.</p>\n<h3 id=\"from-pixels-to-business-value\">From Pixels to Business Value<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#from-pixels-to-business-value\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My sense is that it's not clear how to convert pixels in a satellite image to business value.  There are many possible applications, but relatively few obvious scalable ones.  Any institution wanting to get business value has to go all the way from raw satellite imagery to business value on their own, and that's hard.</p>\n<p>In most industries there's a collection of companies ranging from the broad and horizontal infrastructure products (think DataBricks), to the more vertically specific products (think the thousands of MLOps companies),  and finally to the last-mile consultants, all of whom convert data into insight and value by working together.  Satellite imagery / remote sensing / earth observation doesn't have that ecosystem yet.  We have consultants who read data directly from AWS without any real tooling support.</p>\n<p>It's actually kinda bonkers how much data is available today for how immature\nthis market is.</p>\n<p>There are some horizontal product companies, but they seem to struggle to demonstrate real value on their own.  Product revenue seems small in this vertical.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consulting-companies-do-ok\">Consulting Companies do OK<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#consulting-companies-do-ok\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>There are a few consulting agencies in this space (Development Seed and SparkGeo were well represented at the conference, along with a few independent consultants), and they all seemed to do fine.  They have to be technically capable,  ranging experience from cloud infrastructure, to data science, to understanding verticals like insurance or agriculture.  These groups seemed to be the most collected and respected at the event.</p>\n<p>The consultants seemed to have \"figured it out\" while everyone else was struggling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exception-government-and-defense\">Exception: Government and Defense<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#exception-government-and-defense\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The one exception to \"No one knows how to make money here\" seems to be those companies targeting Defense and civilian government (like NASA).  The larger enterprises (Maxar, Planet) mostly target defense today.  The US-based consultancies (DevSeed/Element84) largely target civilian government.</p>\n<p>The US Government seems to highly value observing the earth and its people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future\">Future?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My sense is that there <em>is</em> significant value here, but that it'll take a while for an symbiotic ecosystem of product and consulting companies to grow up and learn to better deliver business value.</p>\n<p>This feels like the Internet before web search or Oil before the automobile.  Amazing potential, but it's not clear what to actually do with it today.</p>\n<p>There's a ton of potential here.  I don't know if there's a first mover\nadvantage, or if several companies need to try-and-die here, fertilizing the soil before someone can finally thrive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tight-community\">Tight Community<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tight-community\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This community feels the way Scientific Python felt before we got popular.  Everyone is super passionate.  Everyone knows each other.  Everyone is really kind and supportive.  Everyone wants to change the world.  It was a great vibe.</p>\n<p>Mostly it made me miss the days before Python was flooded with money and success (not that I'm complaining about the money and success).</p>\n<p>There was some impractical idealism, but there were also strong and respected voices speaking out for practicality.  It was refreshing hearing people speak so much about business models and what they as a community could do to change things, rather than only wishful thinking about how larger third parties should act.</p>\n<h2 id=\"small-conference-format-was-great\">Small Conference Format was Great<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#small-conference-format-was-great\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This event had a great form factor.</p>\n<p>It was capped at 100 people, had only lightning talks and panels, and had a lot of unstructured and outdoor time.  It was also a pretty specific community.  Ticket prices were modest and my sense is that it wasn't as hard as a proper conference to pull off (not to diminish the effort of the organizers, who were great).</p>\n<p>I think the world could probably use more low-stakes and hyper-specific workshops to complement the broad and large events that dominate most work travel today.  We ran a Dask developers invite-only workshop a few years ago with about 50 people and it felt a little like that.  Great energy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technology-needs\">Technology Needs<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#technology-needs\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>From my perspective as someone who cares about Python+Parallelism+Cloud, mostly this community just needs embarrassingly parallel cloud computing with relatively simple processing.  Even the sophistication of distributed Xarray often feels like overkill here.  I mostly heard people talk about AWS tools like Lambda and Batch, and workflow managers like Prefect and Flyte.</p>\n<p>They're definitely inefficient.  When asked my favorite question \"How much do you think it costs to process 1TB of cloud data\" answers ranged in the $20-50 range (real answer is $0.10) which matches my experience with other semi-technical groups.</p>\n<p>While many people have access to large scale cloud computing, they mostly have over-engineered systems around Kubernetes or cobbled together AWS architectures, typically that reduce to just AWS Batch-or-Lambda.</p>\n<p>When showed Coiled demos people were generally blown away, mostly by ease of use, simplicity of architecture, and cost efficiency.  The sophisticated task graph stuff or ML libraries didn't matter much.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I had a good time (people were great) and learned a lot (people should attend\nevents adjacent to their space more often).

Sacrificing minutes of your time saves days of someone else's, <strong>so\nof course you sacrifice.  You'd be a monster not to</strong>.  Sacrificing for others is\npart of being a human; we're social creatures and helping others is deeply\nrooted in our DNA.</p>\n<p>And helping other people feels great!  Especially when it's so easy.\n<strong>This feeling makes you work long hours</strong>, and squeeze extra time from the odd\ncorners of your day, helping unblock as many people as you can.  Unfortunately,\nyour personal life and ego can fade in service of your project.</p>\n<p>Sometimes this fade results in repressive or self-destructive behaviors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I've put on a few pounds sure, but I don't really have time to go running\n   with this new project starting\"</li>\n<li>\"Yes, this person's behavior makes lose sleep, but if I show how I feel\n   it'll cause chaos because of my position\"</li>\n<li>\"My partner doesn't like it when I work after they come home, but there's a\n   really important project going on, and all they're doing is watching TV.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are natural release mechanisms like venting anger or taking time off that\nstop making sense day-to-day when you're in a position of leverage.  Your time\nand position are too important to let loose.  When these release mechanisms no\nlonger make sense day-to-day, your <strong>leverage swallows part of your identity</strong>\nand, eventually, you break (or at least I do).</p>\n<p>This breaking point is an interesting moment because it's at this point where\nthe entire project is at risk unless you fix a very important problem,\nyourself.</p>\n<p>You can't fix yourself through more sacrifice.  <strong>You can only fix things by\nselfishly prioritizing your needs.</strong>  This is a rare moment in life where egotism\nand altruism are perfectly aligned.  However, prioritizing your needs doesn't\nmean \"do less work\".  Often you can achieve far more effective interventions\nthan just \"work less\".  You can <strong>reshape your relationship to work in more\ncreative ways</strong> than by just stopping.</p>\n<p>This is the moment when you say \"Fuck it\" to your colleagues and start working\nfrom the beach or while motorcycling across America (or whatever).  It's either\nthat or you and the whole system break down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal-examples\">Personal Examples<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#personal-examples\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I've almost quit my job (running an early-stage tech company) several times in\nthe last five years.  Rather than actually quit, I've instead decided to make\nchanges like the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have <a href=\"../meetings/\">no recurring meetings</a></li>\n<li>I don't <a href=\"../slack-github/\">log into Slack</a></li>\n<li>I've checked out of work for a month, focusing more on running and yoga\n    than customers or team morale</li>\n<li>I've bailed on conference talks and company travel for six months</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These actions are <strong>selfish</strong>, but they've also <strong>improved my life\ntremendously</strong> and <strong>saved my relationship with work</strong>, giving me the space to\ncontinue high-leverage work.  If I didn't figure out these creative ways to be\nselfish, I would have broken and everything else would have broken for others\naround me.</p>\n<p>Every time I made a change, I came back with more energy and more impact.\nThese changes improved everyones' outcomes, not just my own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optimize-for-yourself-creatively\">Optimize for Yourself, Creatively<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#optimize-for-yourself-creatively\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>No one has full freedom over their worklife,\n<strong>but everyone has <em>a lot of freedom</em></strong>, far more than they exercise.</p>\n<p>Most founders and other leaders I run into are stressed out.\nMost question their relationship to work.  My advice to them (and to you) is to\n<strong>be selfish, creatively</strong>.  Don't just stop doing work or helping others;\nfigure out very specifically what you want and <strong>design work around what you\nwant</strong>.

Is it a Docker?  How do I upload a pod?\"</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Costs:</strong> Controlling access and costs and usage was impossible</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\"I want my graduate students to use this, but I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll go beyond my budget\"</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> It was difficult to deploy and maintain</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>\"How do I tune my cloud autoscaler?

Dask-gateway replaced dask-kubernetes.  Zarr became more common.  Dask and Xarray both improved in scale.  There were also many extensions of it, with new libraries built on top of Xarray and a wonderful growth in community engagement.</p>\n<p>However overall <strong>this deployment architecture was a technological dead end</strong> (at least in my opinion as original architect).  Personally I\u2019m <strong>proud that we were able to generate so much enthusiasm</strong> (most of the credit here due to Ryan Abernathey, Rich Signell, and others who pushed the Pangeo stack within scientific circles) but mildly ashamed of the architecture itself.  It\u2019s easy to build a cool demo with the Pangeo stack, but difficult to actually solve the computational and business needs of larger organizations.  My experience has been that <strong>the Pangeo stack was fantastic demo-ware</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"present\">Present<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#present\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Since 2018, there have been several re-imaginings of this stack.  There are full-platform options (everything included, but not particularly powerful) and some tool-specific options (innovative and powerful, but require assembly).  Let\u2019s list a few in each category:</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-platform-options\">Full Platform Options<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#full-platform-options\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2I2C</strong> is a classic Kubernetes + JupyterHub architecture similar to what we built in 2018 (pure OSS), but sold with a service to set up and maintain it for organizations that don\u2019t happen to keep a Kuberentes and cloud expert on staff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Nebari</strong> (n\u00e9e QHub) is a better architected execution of the same components, and with more components (workflow managers, editors, \u2026)  Nebari is pure OSS and deployed using git-ops, but recognizing that people need help (OSS isn\u2019t free to maintain) Nebari is often sold with services from Quansight who maintains it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong> took the same UX with Jupyter and Dask (and others tools), but dropped dask-gateway and JupyterHub, and instead added in a proper database-backed web application.  Saturn is a commercial SaaS product with one professionally managed central control plane that can be used anywhere.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"innovative-and-tool-specific-options\">Innovative and Tool-Specific Options<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#innovative-and-tool-specific-options\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coiled (compute)</strong> is what I and people around me built.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coiled focuses exlusively on computation, while also including all of the user management and cost controls that were missing in Pangeo.  Coiled doesn\u2019t serve Jupyter or store data.  Instead, it works with other tools users already have, running from anywhere people run Python (most notably, their existing laptop).</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll claim (perhaps with hubris) that Coiled is among most high-end Python cloud compute platforms on the market today.  This product was built with creativity and soul, and delivers a developer experience that I\u2019m proud of (and user praise seems to back this perspective).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arraylake (storage)</strong> is what Ryan Abernathey and Joe Hamman (the other two primary Pangeo architects) built at Earthmover.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arraylake is a data lake platform built around the Zarr data model which incorporates many database-style features, such as ACID transactions, data version control, fine-grained access controls, and a built-in data catalog.  A bit like Zarr + Git, or Delta Lake if you\u2019re familiar with the dataframe storage space, Arraylake solves many of the data management challenges we experienced in the first iteration of Pangeo.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Other tooling</strong> like workflow managers (Prefect, Dagster), code editors (VS Code), ML/AI tooling (PyTorch, LLMs) and more have come online.  The data infrastructure world today is a vibrant and mercurial environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"status\">Status<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#status\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Today I see a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coiled and Earthmover</strong> deliver an innovative top-shelf experience to some geospatial users, but not many.  Those users tend to be early adopters and low-bureaucracy users like startups rather than older and larger organizations like NASA, weather agencies, and the energy majors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Home Grown Pangeo 1.0 deployments</strong> still get proposed within large agencies by IT groups who want to solve the data accessibility problem, but don\u2019t land well on completion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2I2C and Nabari deployments</strong> are used in more on-prem-ish environments where SaaS isn\u2019t welcome, but end up delivering mostly a JupyterHub+ experience.  While users report enjoying the cloud notebook capability, I haven\u2019t seen an organization succeed with scalable/distributed computing with these platforms in practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single large VMs</strong> tend to be standard.  While simple, this often means that users don\u2019t do full-dataset computations and, ironically, have crazy high cloud bills (single large VMs tend to be set up in a way that they stay on forever, which can be startlingly expensive).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"community-developments\">Community Developments<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#community-developments\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>There has also been a lot of wonderful work in building community around Pangeo, with a thriving <a href=\"https://discourse.pangeo.io/\">discourse forum</a>, numerous third-party packages like xbatcher, xradar, rechunker, etc.., educational groups like <a href=\"https://projectpythia.org/\">Project Pythia</a>, and more.</p>\n<p>While core technological innovation has struggled, there\u2019s been a lot of innovation on the human side.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re at a strange place where we have a compelling POC (thanks Pangeo 1.0!) that\u2019s motivated a lot of people to act, but no great place for them to go just yet.  We also have an encouraging set of next-generation products (Coiled, Arraylake, Prefect, \u2026) pointing the way to a bright future, but nothing that a mature organization can easily pull off the shelf. Procuring and integrating services from multiple different SaaS vendors comes with its own set of headaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future\">Future<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>So what should we do here?  What does the Pangeo 2.0 platform look like?  Ryan Abernathey and I were discussing this topic last week over drinks and started shooting lots of ideas at each other.</p>\n<p>Is it just Coiled with notebooks and regular jobs?<br/>\nArraylake but with online update algorithms?<br/>\nDoes Saturn do everything people need?<br/>\nMaybe it has to be on-prem like Nebari for government folks, but with a proper user database?  Can we get government on Cloud SaaS?<br/>\nMaybe there are many different architectures for different kinds of applications and so organizations are fated to DIY?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give some of my opinionated constraints below.  I think that we got some things right with Coiled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/why.html#how-raw-cloud-architecture\"><strong>Raw-cloud architecture</strong></a> rather than Kubernetes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/why.html#how-environment-synchronization\"><strong>Environment synchronization</strong></a> rather than Docker images</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/costs/index.html\"><strong>Cost controls</strong></a> <strong>and <a href=\"https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/users/index.html\">user management</a> in a database</strong>, rather than JupyterHub/Kubernetes</li>\n<li><strong>Centrally managed SaaS product</strong> with one set of operators, rather than several instances of the same stack</li>\n<li><strong>Trivial integrations</strong> with other tools (our integration is just <code>import coiled</code> in a Python prompt)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But maybe we got some things wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notebooks:</strong> while I still believe that notebooks and computation should be separable (it\u2019s important to drive computations from things-other-than-notebooks) I now realize that single-node cloud notebooks are sometimes valuable, especially for organizations who want to deliver a more curated and homogenous experience to a population of non-power-users.  (I tend to overweight the experience of power-users)</li>\n<li><strong>Regular Batch Jobs:</strong> while I still believe in integrating with best-in-class workflow orchestration products like Prefect/Dagster, some organizations want something trivial baked-in, particularly when migrating from an on-prem HPC-style environment</li>\n<li><strong>SaaS:</strong> I\u2019m actually still pretty convinced that this is the right way forward.  SaaS within government agencies has proven a major source of friction, but the development velocity is just so much faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, I\u2019ll follow with some perhaps unpopular organizational perspectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deployment Infrastructure should be SaaS rather than OSS</strong></li>\n<li>Faster iteration (we can release daily rather than monthly)</li>\n<li>Better visibility (we can see every failure, often before users do)</li>\n<li>Maintenance costs are a tiny fraction when shared among different user groups\n    (we service hundreds of companies with a tiny cloud dev staff)</li>\n<li><strong>For-profit companies</strong> move faster than the community</li>\n<li>Most organizations mostly care about if it works, rather than who builds it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I still have lots of questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What key activities and pain points are people looking to solve today?</strong>\n  What features do you need?</li>\n<li>Dask / Xarray features?</li>\n<li>User / cost / administration features?</li>\n<li>Notebooks in the cloud?</li>\n<li>Better Scalability?</li>\n<li>Batch jobs / workflow orchestration?</li>\n<li>Databases and data catalogs?</li>\n<li><strong>How do geo-specific organizations buy software?</strong></li>\n<li>Do you buy software or do you build everything yourself?</li>\n<li>Do you deploy SaaS or do things have to be installed on-prem or in fully-isolated cloud VPCs?</li>\n<li>Who makes these decisions?  What do they care about?</li>\n<li>How do science users impact this decision-making process?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve made it to the end of this post then I could use your help answering these questions.  If you or someone you know works at an institution that buys this kind of software and are open to a 30 minute conversation, then I\u2019d like to probe your brain with a few questions like these and gather your perspective.</p>\n<p>Send me an e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:pangeo-2-discovery@coiled.io\">pangeo-2.0-discovery@coiled.io</a> and I\u2019ll schedule a chat this week.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/pangeo-2.0.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-09-18T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/usage-based-pricing/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/usage-based-pricing/", "title": "Usage Based Pricing", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"pivoting-away-from-usage-based-pricing\">Pivoting away from Usage Based Pricing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#pivoting-away-from-usage-based-pricing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>We're moving away from usage based pricing.</p>\n<p>This post talks about the pros and cons of usage based pricing in our\nsituation, and then talks through alternatives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/92vpi1.jpg\" alt=\"Usage based pricing meme\"\nwidth=\"40%\" align=\"center\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"where-we-are-today\">Where we are today<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#where-we-are-today\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>People who follow my blog may recall that ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have a product people love</li>\n<li>But we weren't selling it well</li>\n<li>So we hired AEs (new!)</li>\n<li>They're working out fantastically well (new!)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hooray \ud83c\udf89!  The bottom of our funnel now flows decently and our revenue is\ndramatically increasing (easy to increase dramatically when it starts low \ud83d\ude42)</p>\n<p>However, now we have a different problem.  Pricing!  Today our biggest problem\nis figuring out how to capture more of the value we generate for customers\nwhile also making them feel good about paying us.  This problem is tricky.</p>\n<p>Today, we do usage-based pricing.  This was good for a while, but ended up\nbeing a bit of a dead end for us.  Let's talk through why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-usage-based-pricing-was-great\">Why Usage Based Pricing was Great<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#why-usage-based-pricing-was-great\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Previously, we charged $0.05 per CPU-Hour, the same as major clouds or\nDatabricks.  We liked this when getting started for a few reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s simple</strong> and it\u2019s easy to understand quickly</li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s standard</strong> in our space and so familiar to buyers</li>\n<li><strong>It starts small</strong> so on-boarding isn't focused on financials</li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s on-par</strong> with other things the customer is already paying for (the cloud in this case)\n    so we know that they have budget for bills like this</li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s unbounded</strong> so if a company does really really well, we can make a lot of money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mostly it was a simple default choice, and a good basis for a pricing scheme.\nIt\u2019s minimally scary, and so good at getting people in the door.</p>\n<p>But eventually it broke down.  Let\u2019s talk about how, and then we\u2019ll talk about what we do today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-usage-based-pricing-was-terrible-for-us\">Why Usage Based Pricing was Terrible (for us)<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#why-usage-based-pricing-was-terrible-for-us\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>There were a few fail cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers for whom our product was critical infrastructure (high value) but whose usage was\n   really small (low price)</li>\n<li>Customers where we optimized their workloads 10-100x, and so reduced our\n   revenue 10-100x (misaligned priorities)</li>\n<li>Customers who didn't like percentage increases on their usage\n    (like how paying $10 for a bottle of water feels bad at an event)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider the following conversation as an example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer</strong>: You charge a 100% markup.  That\u2019s too high.</p>\n<p>I was expecting closer to 30-40%.  I\u2019m paying $2,000 monthly to AWS and $2,000 to you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Us</strong>: Yes, but before using us you ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>were paying $20,000 to AWS because you were so inefficient</li>\n<li>\n<p>were spending half an FTE maintaining that terrible  infrastructure</p>\n<p>(costing 50% * $200k == $100,000/year)\n    -   had a data science team of five was spending 20% of their time fighting\nthat terrible infrastructure</p>\n<p>(costing 5 * 20% * $200k == $200,000 / year)\n    -   couldn't finish that project that was critical to your business\nand which you were just able to finish in a couple weeks since using us</p>\n<p>(the value of which only you can determine, but is probably higher than the rest)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer</strong>: Oh yeah, I guess that's right.  I guess this is worth the\n   $2,000 you're asking for</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Us:</strong> actually, now that I think about it, we should probably be charging\n   you much more</p>\n<p>(I never actually said this last part, but it was a frequent thought).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were two problems here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We captured only a small fraction</strong> of the benefit we provided to users</li>\n<li><strong>Users felt bad</strong> about the small fraction that we did capture</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Something was clearly wrong here.  Users value our product beyond what\nthey pay (they\u2019re getting a great deal!) but they feel like they\u2019re\ngetting screwed, and that's not good for anyone.</p>\n<p>I've learned that pricing is as much about psychology as about aligning cost and value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-did-this-not-work-out-for-us\">Why did this not work out for us?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#why-did-this-not-work-out-for-us\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Usage-based pricing is the norm for computational cloud products.  Why does it\nwork for others (like AWS or Databricks) but not for us?</p>\n<p>I have a few theories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> we're just much better at making users efficient.</p>\n<p>Users often come in with $100,000 annual cloud bills, but after using the\nproduct realize they only need to spend $5,000-10,000.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of cloud usage today is misuse and our product stops\nmisuse.  Stopping misuse is great for the user (\ud83c\udf89) and bad for the cloud (\ud83c\udf89).\nHowever, it's also bad for us (\ud83d\ude1e) under usage based pricing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Python</strong> is more prone to these 100x efficiency swings than other\n    technologies, like SQL, where 2-5x is more common.</p>\n<p>Python can be either incredibly efficient or inefficient based on\nexpertise.  With our product novices are less cost-prone, both because of\nthe product itself, and because of our incredible support team (more on\nthis later)</p>\n<p>We could make the product worse or stop giving good support and we'd\nprobably earn more but this doesn't feel great.  There's clearly a lot of\nvalue that we can generate and would like to capture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SMBs</strong> for velocity reasons we mostly focus on Small and Medium\n    Businesses (SMBs) rather than large enterprises.</p>\n<p>SMBs tend to value human performance more than cloud spend (humans and\nspeed are more expensive than cloud at this scale).  Maybe our focus here\nputs us in a strange place where the main value we provide isn't aliged\nwith cloud cost, but rather human acceleration.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After seeing the $100,000 -&gt; $5,000 transition a few times and cursing the\nefficiency of our product we started rethinking how we price the product.</p>\n<p>So let's look at some possible new solutions.  Before that though, let's talk\nbriefly about what we sell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-we-sell\">What do we sell?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-do-we-sell\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In general people like using Coiled because they get to operate at larger\nscale more smoothly than before.  This is due to a couple of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product:</strong> the Coiled product is powerful and has a UX that feels good\n    to Python data devs.  It's a powerful tool that's comfortable to wield.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support:</strong> the product also tells <em>us</em> a lot about what users do, and our\n    support team reaches out proactively as we see users struggle.\n    One Coiled support engineer easily unblocks a dozen users daily.</p>\n<p>Users <em>love</em> our support team, and describe it as unlike anything else\nthey've experienced.\nIt's like we've constructed a platform that enables us to do lots of high\nimpact micro-consulting.  Unfortunately, the market isn't used to this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The product is hard to price because of the efficiency issues with Python\n(we often make people 10x more efficient and so shoot ourselves in the foot).</p>\n<p>The support is hard to price because we're trapped in between two things people\nare used to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Typical (bad) product support</strong> most SaaS products have some support tier\n    that costs 20% on top of usage and offers access to a mediocre support\n    experience.  I've personally never found value in SaaS support teams.</p>\n<p>This is like what we do, but cheaper and worse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Professional Services</strong> consulting firms charge by the hour to unblock\n    customers.  This is much more valuable, but a way of working that's also\n    pretty distracting and that we're not set up to do (I'm done counting\n    hours).</p>\n<p>This is more like the value we provide, but operationally quite different\n(we dont bill hourly and we only work on what we want to).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our support is similar enough that we get pattern matched to existing\nofferings, but different enough that those approaches don't make sense for us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"objectives-for-a-good-pricing-scheme\">Objectives for a good pricing scheme<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#objectives-for-a-good-pricing-scheme\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>So let's say we want to invent something new?  What are some objectives?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Easy to start</strong> using the product without worrying</p>\n<p>(we want the customer to see the value of the product before thinking about money)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Total price</strong> matches the value the customer sees and can pay, so if a customer\n    ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is unable to pay anything (like a student) it should be free</li>\n<li>is getting a lot of value and is able to pay, it should cost a lot\n    (but less than the value they experience)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mentally easy for the customer</strong> to connect price to value</p>\n<p>We want the customer to be able to easily understand the price and connect\nit to the value they're getting.  So for example if most of our value is\naccelerating their people, then we should charge per person.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"what-were-trying-today\">What we're trying today<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-were-trying-today\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Today we're rolling out a change to <a href=\"https://www.coiled.io/pricing\">our pricing</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For basic/individual users not much changes</strong>.  It's still usage-based which\n   makes it easy to test things out without thinking too hard.  We are putting\n   some seat-caps on this tier though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For larger teams we switch to usage + seat based pricing.</strong>  We charge\n   some very small percentage of an FTE cost per seat.  This is big enough to\n   be meaningful to us, while small enough that when the customer asks\n   themselves \"How much more efficient is my team with this tool?\" they come up\n   with an answer that is far larger than the percentage we charge.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#future-work\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This feels better but still not great.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It feels good that we're shifting to human-based pricing (to match the human-based value we think we generate)</li>\n<li>But human-based value feels <em>squishy</em> and hard to quantify, which requires\n    more thinking on the user's part, and more conversation on ours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have our work cut out for us.  I look forward to seeing how this lands.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/usage-based-pricing.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-09-04T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/feedback/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/feedback/", "title": "How GitHub taught me to Micromanage", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"how-github-taught-me-to-micromanage\">How GitHub taught me to Micromanage<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-github-taught-me-to-micromanage\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>Feedback is critical to performing good work as a team.\nGood feedback cultivates quality work and professional growth.\nBad feedback degrades quality and erodes relationships.</p>\n<p>This article explains my experience of feedback in open source community code\nreview, and the culture that emerged from intense detailed feedback.

These weren't corporate environments.  These were a bunch\nof volunteers working together to build something awesome used by rest of the\nworld.  There were no managers, no performance reviews, no video meetings, no\nmeetings at all in fact.  There was just the work, and the work was the focus of all\ncommunication.</p>\n<p>The work took three forms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Issues:</strong> where we discussed concerns and considered technical designs as a group</li>\n<li><strong>Coding:</strong> where one person would write a solution to the proposed issue</li>\n<li><strong>Code Review:</strong> where anyone could drop in, review the code, and provide feedback.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most of the work was in <em>Code Review</em>, not <em>Coding</em> (writing code is a\nvanishingly small fraction software development) and so I spent several hours\nevery day, for years, giving and receiving highly detailed feedback from fellow\ncollaborators.  This is where we taught each other.  This is where we learned\nto align on mission and style.  This is where we expressed humor and learned\nabout each others' character and about our own.</p>\n<p>Let's see an example</p>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#example\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In this example we see some simple proposed code below, and then consider\nbad/ok/good feedback on that code.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed code</strong></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">element</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">element</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Bad Review</strong></p>\n<p><em>Please don't use for loops.

This community and practice\nis the reason for my success in career, which has transformed my life.  I am\ngrateful.

As an example, let's consider the\nfollowing exchange over a google doc:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../images/google-doc-review.png\" /></p>\n<p>When I first transitioned from OSS dev to CEO at a startup I did <em>lots</em> of review\nlike this.  What I found were questions/concerns/problems like the following\n(all of which are valid in hindsight)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is the CEO correcting my grammar?</li>\n<li>If you want these changes, why not just edit the doc directly?</li>\n<li>This doc isn't high priority. Why do you want to talk about this so much?</li>\n<li>Why do you keep telling me how bad I am at writing?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions confused me.  I realized that it was because that the implicit\nmessage received behind my feedback was very different.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implicit-messages\">Implicit messages<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#implicit-messages\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>There was a major difference in the implicit message that is being received in\nthe first open source case than in the second corporate case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> <em>I believe in you and your work.  I see potential for you to\n   get even better at your craft and would be proud to invest my time to see that happen.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Corporate:</strong> You're doing a bad job.  I'm going to explain, in minute\n   detail, exactly what you did wrong, over and over again because I hate you\n   and want you to suffer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What before was a supportive behavior is now an abusive one.\nEverything depends on context.</p>\n<p><em>Note: to be clear, this miscommunication isn't the receiever's fault.  We as\nreviewers need to better model our context so we can anticipate how\nfeedback will be received.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"corporate-mindset\">Corporate Mindset<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#corporate-mindset\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This negative reception feels more reasonable when you consider the mindset and\ncontext in which this work is done.  Referring back to the OSS Mindset above,\nlet's compare with corporate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honing a craft:</strong> in old-school community OSS people cared <em>a lot</em> about\n   getting better at development.  Micro-adjustments to our form were really\n   valuable to us.  Development skill was a big part of our (or at least my) self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conversely in corporate few people care as deeply about the craft of\n   writing, meeting facilitation, graphic design, etc..  Skillbuilding is nice,\n   but it's secondary to getting work done.

Probably the company would go quickly out of business, but it's a fun\nthought to consider, and maybe apply a little bit of in our everyday life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-reception-budget\">Feedback Reception Budget<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#feedback-reception-budget\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>And so, I've learned that a person can absorb only about one piece of feedback\nper interaction, and then only if it's labeled very specifically as feedback\nwith the best intentions, and wrapped delicately in a feedback sandwich.</p>\n<p>Because of this volume constraint, infrequent feedback must be more general and\nhigher level, ideally accompanied by impersonal assets like a blogpost that the\nrecipient of the feedback can read separately (this is partially why I write\nblogposts).</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-please\">But please ...<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#but-please\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>For the love of god ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove filler words like \"really\", \"very\" or anything else that doesn't change\n   the meaning of a sentence</li>\n<li>Do not start meetings by asking everyone to introduce themselves</li>\n<li>Attach agendas to meetings ahead of time</li>\n<li>When making slides think about text contrast and use alignment guide-lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for listening, hopefully this article ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Helps people around me understand the implicit message behind my feedback</li>\n<li>Gives everyone desiring a spirit of craftsmanship more interest in\n    developing a strong culture of constant constructive feedback</li>\n</ol>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/feedback.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-05-11T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/hiring-sales/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/hiring-sales/", "title": "Hiring Sales", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"hiring-sales\">Hiring Sales<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#hiring-sales\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>We're relaunching our enterprise sales effort after improving product-market\nfit.  However, it's an interesting challenge finding just the right person.\nThis post goes into a bit of our history, what we're looking for in an early\nsales hire, and my experience engaging with this process.</p>\n<p>This post may interest you if ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You're interviewing with me and I've pointed you to this post</li>\n<li>You're curious about startups generally</li>\n<li>You want to recommend someone in your network (please do!)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#history\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>A couple years ago we had a sales team, but our product was bad and so the\nsales team was premature.  We fired them (and a bunch of other people) and\nfocused on making a delightful product.</p>\n<p>Then, because we didn't have a sales team we focused on making a product that a\nuser could on-board, use, and pay for all without talking to us.  Surprisingly,\nthis worked, and today we have a nice machine that generates happy champions\nwithin small teams that pay low thousands of dollars per month (but rarely\nmore).</p>\n<p>These people pay us money, but not that much.  We've been encouraged by two\nrecent learnings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A little bit of customer support as they onboard greatly accelerates consumption</li>\n<li>After talking to customers, we realize that there are often much larger\n    opportunities just behind the initial team that lands with us.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given this, we're hiring a sales team again.  This should be a fun opportunity\nfor early-stage-oriented sales folks because ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>We have a solid pipeline of inbound leads.</strong></p>\n<p>Our product mints new champions regularly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Our current sales numbers suck</strong>, mostly because we haven't done anything.</p>\n<p>It's a great opportunity for someone to say \"I was the first salesperson on\nthe ground and took them from $0 to $N million in two years\" which is a\ngreat way for someone to graduate from AE/SE to VP of Sales in their next\nposition (or this one) and maximize lifetime income.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"team-composition\">Team Composition<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#team-composition\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Ideally we want people who have three skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know how to sell</strong></p>\n<p>Know how to empower champions, navigate an org chart, find economic\nbuyers, identify pain and goals, speak to that pain and those goals,\nnegotiate with precurement and legal, etc..</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know our space</strong> (data infrastructure, open source, Python)</p>\n<p>Familiar with Python/Spark/Cloud/Devops/Data/ML/...  So for example when\nsomeone says that they're having trouble with some technology, say Argo,\nknow that that means \"workflow management\" and direct them to the right\nsolution within our product.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of incidental complexity here that takes a while to learn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Are intellectually curious</strong>, comfortable in startups,  and excited to be\n    creative and invent new systems</p>\n<p>There's really nothing in place to define how to do the job.  Hopefully\nthis excites rather than scares you.  Also, we have a distinct\ncommunication style (direct, critical, thoughtful) and hopefully you click\nwith that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This person probably doesn't exist, so we'll happily settle for two out of\nthree, and we'll just build a team to round things out.  Probably this team\nlooks a little like ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Executive</li>\n<li>Sales Engineer</li>\n<li>Field Engineer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"interviewing-aes-is-hard\">Interviewing AEs is Hard<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#interviewing-aes-is-hard\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>We've got good candiates for Field and Sales Engineers.  AEs are harder for us\nto connect to though.  There are lots of great candidates out there, but it's\nbeen harder to come to a sense of conviction with an AE so far.</p>\n<p>My experience interviewing AEs so far has been that they say fairly generic\nthings like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'll succeed by finding the buyer, figuring out what their pain is, and then\n   demonstrating how we solve that pain</li>\n<li>I did this with big name company X, where I built the relationship over many\n   months, and built the deal to $X million</li>\n<li>We should sell where the money is</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everyone says these things, and while I wholeheartedly agree with these points,\nthey don't differentiate a candidate, and they don't say anything specific\nabout our situation.   My assumption is that <a href=\"../think/\">early stage startups are\ndifferent from each other</a>, and that what works for one is unlikely to\ntransfer to another automatically.</p>\n<p>So, AEs that I interview, here's the cheat code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Assume that I know more about sales than a typical engineer\n    (you can save time by not explaining basic concepts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get to a point in our conversation where we are conversing about strategy\n    at a non-generic level.</p>\n<p>To do this you will likely need to ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a lot smarter about our situation pretty quickly,\n    this probably means asking questions that are useful to you</li>\n<li>Pause ... and think</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If it looks like I want to say something, notice, and open some space.\n    I'm very interested in how well we can communicate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of otherwise qualified AEs that come in and give the impression that\nthey have all the answers (despite not knowing much about our situation) is odd\nto me.  My <em>guess</em> is that they're assuming that I'm looking for someone to say\n\"everything's going to be ok, I've got this\" convincingly enough and so that's\ntheir main/only message. However, to me saying that with conviction but without\nunderstanding our situation is a strongly negative signal.</p>\n<p>What I'm actually looking for is someone who can demonstrate that they're able\nto think and solve my problem specifically, not today, but over many months\nafter failing quickly many times and thinking through new strategies.  My\nassumption is that any answer you have today is likely wrong, so if you have\nstrong conviction on that answer I'll probably assume that you're mentally\ninflexible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faqs\">FAQs<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#faqs\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>To accelerate the interview process a bit, here are some frequently asked\nquestions by sales folks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your runway?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We have two-ish years of runway, assuming we don't make any money</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your goals?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I'd love to get to $5mm ARR in that time (but you tell me what you\nthink is feasible, and we'll adjust strategy together) probably with a\nmixture of small and large deals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How much room is there to grow?  (could I end up managing sales?)</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, if you're good.  I don't promise anything though.\nHonestly, if you're really good then you can have my job :)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/hiring-sales.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-04-29T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}]}
