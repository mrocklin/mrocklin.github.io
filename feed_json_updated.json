We were in a green field inventing the future against all odds, rather than maintaining legacy software under an increasing weight of success.</p>\n<p>Today I see people working on personal side-projects, goofing around, playing.</p>\n<p>I'm reminded of these quotes from director Francis Ford Coppola during the making of his recent film/boondoggle, Megalopolis</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You know why I'm doing this?

You can tell how I learned from one into the next.</p>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>First Try</summary>\n<p>I'm curious about trying an agent swarm technique in development. I was thinking as a project we might try adding a react electron version of this application.</p>\n<p>We'd want to have one agent (you) doing a lot of the orchestration, but we'd want other agents for planning, executing each task, reviewing, testing, etc.. You wouldn't do any work directly because you'd be conserving your context to control others.</p>\n<p>I want you to think hard about this and how to execute well.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>Second Try: I encourage communication</summary>\n<p>Let's play with multi-agent swarm systems. As a project, I want to build a viewer for sessions. I'm thinking that this is probably a local application, maybe electron that takes a session file and renders it nicely. Eventually I'm going to want to render a few of these side-by-side (to better understand multi-agent systems), but I think that to start we probably just want to get to a milestone where we have an app that runs that can present a session nicely.</p>\n<p>For tech we're going to want react/shadcn/tailwind with zustand for state.</p>\n<p>For design we're going to want to copy our theme and styling here.</p>\n<p>For execution I think we probably want different agents for planning, building, and reviewing. Each building agent should also launch an agent to review its work as it gets close to done (or we should launch it if it forgets). Assuming we use worktrees we're going to want to merge work as it completes rather than all at once. Probably we want a separate integration agent for this. Agents should be encouraged to ask each other questions and collaborate. We shouldn't do much work in this agent. We need to preserve our context.</p>\n<p>Think about how best to organize this and then set it going.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"faq\">\n<summary>Third try. I wanted to limit concurrency.</summary>\n<p>I'd like to experiment with agent swarms.</p>\n<p>As a project, I'd like us to build a session viewer that takes in a session, like the .jsonl file on the Desktop, and renders it similarly to how we do in the app, but with an electron app using react/tailwind/shadcn.</p>\n<p>As we work on things I want you to use different agents in different roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For our architecture I suspect that we'll want an agent to make an overall plan,</li>\n<li>and then we'll want to break apart that plan into a set of tasks with dependencies that agents can work on independently.</li>\n<li>We won't want to start everything at once of course. We'll want to pay attention to laying a good foundation first and making sure it's good before moving on.</li>\n<li>As we can parallelize we will.</li>\n<li>Also, as any agent starts to finish up work they should use the /review skill to create another agent to review their efforts.</li>\n<li>When they're done they should use the finalize_worktree mcp command to work on merging their work to this upstream viewer branch, which will be the target of all of our work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You won't do much work, instead saving your context to help orchestrate the other agents.</p>\n<p>Think hard about how to do this well.</p>\n</details>\n<p>If I were to do this again, I think I would sequentialize the entire process.  Parallelism didn't buy much.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-overall-experience-was-mediocre\">The overall experience was mediocre<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-overall-experience-was-mediocre\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My experience with agentic swarms was so-so.  That's not surprising.  I'm new at it and bad at it.</p>\n<p>As Steve Yegge (famed multi-agent vibe coder) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will turn into Batman, but you can't just put on the suit and say \"I'm Batman\".</p>\n<p>You've got to learn how the tool-belt works</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My experience was learning that I'm definitely not Batman yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"observations\">Observations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#observations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The head agent delegated really well.  It understood that its context was\nprecious and how to create agents to do work.  And the plan that was designed was fine.</p>\n<p>But parallel execution was generally pretty bad.  The agents did fine work, but\nthey mostly ignored each other the first go around.  The second time I\nintentionally prompted the system to chat with peers about the work they were\ndoing, and the third time I encouraged less parallelism.  Still though,\nlack of coordination resulted in lots of strangeness.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, the crap it produced was quickly cleaned up by more AI (the\nsolution to AI problems is more AI).</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons-learned\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>As with any philosophy, we should neither accept nor reject it, but should take\nfrom it the parts that suit us.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, here are my current lessons on multi-agent behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"separate-reviewer\">Separate Reviewer \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#separate-reviewer\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Upon finishing work I used to ask Claude to review its own work:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's review our recent changes and see if there is anything we can clean up or simplify</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I still do that, but I follow up with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start another agent and ask it to review our work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They're both quite useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fresh-perspective\">Fresh Perspective \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#fresh-perspective\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Agents get tired.  If an agent finishes an especially long session and its context is near 60-70% I'll often ask the reviewing agent to take over and implement the changes.</p>\n<p>It's better, of course, to avoid this with well-scoped work, just like a regular human developer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mythical-man-month-mythical-ai-minute\">Mythical Man Month \u27a1\ufe0f Mythical AI Minute<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#mythical-man-month-mythical-ai-minute\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Also like humans, sometimes teams don't perform as well as single developers.</p>\n<p>There's a real cost to coordination that needs to be outweighed by the benefits of speed.  AI agents are so fast that it's not clear to me when we'd want multiple agents working concurrently on the same code\u2014most tasks finish before coordination overhead would pay off.</p>\n<p>My experiment would have been better with many agents, each agent running after the other finished.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agent-support\">Agent Support \ud83d\udc4d<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#agent-support\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Increasingly, the model I have for hard problems is to work with one key agent at a time, and fire off supporting agents to handle tangential work (research, review, performance testing).</p>\n<p>It's valuable to keep a key agent on task. (also like humans)</p>\n<h3 id=\"human-coordination\">Human Coordination \ud83e\udde0<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#human-coordination\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I am not (yet) a fan of YOLO Swarms.  I want to be involved.</p>\n<p>Said differently, all the work I'm doing is sufficiently important to me that I'm happy to pay attention to it.  I'm curious about how to best optimize my ability to pay attention to AI work.</p>\n<p>I don't think this is universally true.  For example during Dask's peak, OSS maintenance was such that I would have welcomed agents handling the first layer of support.  Very few of us are in that situation though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"human-oriented-ai-development\">Human-Oriented AI Development<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#human-oriented-ai-development\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Working on Claude Chic has made me increasingly interested in how I work as a developer, and how to optimize that experience.  Rather than ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can I use multi-agent swarms?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am instead asking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is holding me back right now?</p>\n<p>How can I best address that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today the answer is around ergonomics and context management rather than concurrency (I feel I already have concurrency in abundance).  There are great multi-agent workflows I've mentioned above that I use daily.  I'm not yet a YOLO Swarm / Gas Town guy.</p>\n<p>I haven't really made up my mind though; I should experiment for more than 48 hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"experimenting-is-easy\">Experimenting is easy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#experimenting-is-easy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>This is a blatant ad for <a href=\"/introducing-claude-chic\">Claude Chic</a>, but it was pretty trivial to play with (admittedly bad) swarm architectures.</p>\n<p>Claude has enough of an understanding of swarms that, if you describe what you want and give it the ability to make agents that talk to each other (like Claude Chic does), then you can just start playing immediately.</p>\n<p>Regardless what you think about AI, and regardless how you think about\nfull-auto multi-agent swarms, you should experiment with them.

They're also concerns that I suspect came\naround when we developed compilers and people stopped writing assembly by hand,\ninstead trusting programs like <code>gcc</code> to pump out instruction after instruction\nof shitty machine code.</p>\n<p>We lost a deeper understanding as developers when we stopped writing assembly\nbut we gained a ton too.  As in any transition, we need to navigate the\nsituation to capture the advantages while losing only a little, balancing the\ncosts and benefits of a new technology.</p>\n<p>This article is how I've been navigating this transition personally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-minimize-interruptions-climb-abstraction-hierarchy\">Big Idea: Minimize Interruptions / Climb Abstraction Hierarchy<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-minimize-interruptions-climb-abstraction-hierarchy\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Early in using Claude Code (or Cursor) many of my interactions were saying\n\"Yes, it's ok to run that\".  This was <strong>frustrating and dehumanizing</strong>.  Mostly my\njob was to enable AI, rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>There are many tricks to resolve this (see below), but more broadly <strong>\"stop doing\nsimple shit\"</strong> has been a mantra that I've found myself constantly coming\nback to. The more I identify and reject simple tasks and add automation to my\nworkflow, the higher an abstraction I'm able to climb to and the more\neffectively I'm able to work. Our goal in programming is to climb an\nabstraction ladder and gain more intellectual leverage. This requires thought\nand consistent attention.</p>\n<p>Fortunately AI can help with this.  If you complain and say \"I'm always doing\nX\" it'll suggest solutions like what I'll talk about below, but more tailored\nto your situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-hooks\">Tip: Hooks<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-hooks\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>AI developers, like human developers, benefit from structure.</p>\n<p>Most people start with an <code>AGENTS.md</code> or <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file.

The real\nsolution for me here (at least for Claude Code) is\n<a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks\">Hooks</a>.</p>\n<p>First, let's outline a couple of annoyingly common problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-problem-ignoring-instructions-in-claudemd\">Example Problem: Ignoring instructions in CLAUDE.md<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#example-problem-ignoring-instructions-in-claudemd\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Let's say you tell AI that you want to run tests with <code>uv</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when running tests, use <code>uv run pytest tests</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this works sometimes, AI often decides to run</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>$ pytest tests/\ncommand not found: pytest\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>While the agents read CLAUDE.md, they don't always follow the instructions.\nAnd so you're stuck saying \"no, use <code>uv</code>\"  over and over again.

Mostly this works because I've gotten good at giving Claude\nfairly broad-yet-safe <strong>permissions</strong>, which is coming up next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-problem-incomplete-permissions\">Example Problem: Incomplete Permissions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#example-problem-incomplete-permissions\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Even worse, Claude often asks for permission to do things that are just\nslightly different from what you've already granted.\nYou allow <code>uv run pytest *</code>, but Claude keeps finding variants:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>timeout 60 uv run pytest ...\ntimeout 40 uv run pytest ...\nuv run pytest ... | head\n.venv/bin/pytest ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Claude Code's permission language sucks.  It only supports prefixes, while I\nwish it could handle regexes, or maybe even just arbitrary Python code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution-hooks-for-permissions\">Solution: Hooks for permissions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#solution-hooks-for-permissions\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"#appendix-permissions-file\">complex Python script</a> as a hook which overrides the permission\nsystem.  It uses regexes, but also arbitrary Python code as logic.  This allows\nme to encode arbitrary combinations of rules.  It's great.</p>\n<p>On the rare occasion when Claude asks me for permission for something new, I\nhave a running Claude agent that thinks about this file and considers if it\nshould update the permission script.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution-hooks-for-sounds\">Solution: Hooks for sounds<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#solution-hooks-for-sounds\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>My personal favorite hooks though are these:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">&quot;Stop&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;hooks&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;afplay -v 0.40 /System/Library/Sounds/Morse.aiff&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">],</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&quot;Notification&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;hooks&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nt\">&quot;command&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;afplay -v 0.35 /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>They play subtle little sounds whenever Claude is either done, or needs input\nfrom me.  This lets me ignore Claude when it's busy.  Previously I found that I\nwas constantly checking back in with Claude to see if it was done, and that\naction was dehumanizing, so I automated it by asking Claude to play a sound.</p>\n<p>Hooks are great.  There are more ways to provide structure (Skills, Commands)\nbut I've found that Hooks are the most dependable, a great starting place, and\noften augment any other structure that I put in place (like Skills).</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-build-confidence-without-looking-at-code\">Big Idea: Build Confidence Without Looking at Code<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-build-confidence-without-looking-at-code\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In a recent large AI-assisted PR a frustrated reviewer said the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To me, this [size of PR] implies that either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reviewers should blindly trust Claude, or</li>\n<li>reviewers should spend the months worth of effort going through Claude's changes, without the developer bothering to do the same first.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a valid problem, even in single-person projects.  <strong>We're able to generate\ncode far more quickly than we're able to read it</strong>.  How should we handle\nreview?  Everyone needs to figure this out for themselves, but my answer is\n\"find other ways to build confidence\".</p>\n<p>We already do this today with human-written code.  I review some code very\nclosely, and other code less-so.  Sometimes I rely on a combination of tests,\nfamiliarity of a well-known author, and a quick glance at the code to before\nsaying \"sure, seems fine\" and pressing the green button.  I might also ask\n\"Have you thought of X\" and see what they say.</p>\n<p>Trusting code without reading all of it isn't new, we're just now in a state\nwhere we need to review 10x more code, and so we need to get much better at\nestablishing confidence that something works without paying human attention all\nthe time.</p>\n<p>We can augment our ability to write code with AI.  <strong>We can augment our ability\nto review code with AI too.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-self-review\">Tip: Self-review<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-self-review\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"testing\">Testing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#testing\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Mostly I establish confidence on AI-generated work by investing heavily in\ntests and benchmarks, the same as I would with humans, just moreso.  TDD is\nbaked into most of the prompting structure I have with agents.</p>\n<p>Remember that this is way cheaper than it used to be.  Now rather than write a\nbenchmark I can type</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does this compare in performance to the old version?  I'm particularly\ninterested in memory use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it.  If it's bad, the agent will say so (and then diligently work to\nmake it good).</p>\n<h3 id=\"grilling\">Grilling<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#grilling\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Additionally, if I'm nervous about something subtle like <em>\"Is it possible this change\nmight unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?\"</em> then I'll ask the\nAI exactly that question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible this change might unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it'll just go and investigate exactly that question.  Unlike human authors,\nthe AI has no ego at stake in its work, and isn't in the least bit lazy.  It's\nour job to ask <em>\"Have you thought of X\"</em> and its job to go learn if that might\nbe an issue.  Don't trust its answer?  Ask it to prove it to you.</p>\n<p>AI has flaws, but it is diligent, and it lacks ego.  If you question it, it'll\ninvestigate thoroughly and critique its own work honestly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"simplifying\">Simplifying<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#simplifying\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Also, my favorite command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's review our work and see if there is anything we can simplify or clean up</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before Opus 4.5 came out this was essential.  Now it's merely nice.  I've\nturned this into a <code>/cleanup</code> command and integrated it into most of my Skills\nas a final phase in development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tech-debt\">Tech debt<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tech-debt\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>From time to time I also ask a fresh agent to do a full review of the project,\nwith an eye to cleaning up technical debt.  I tell it to review everything and\nthink hard.  It takes a while, but it often comes back with a nice list of work\nfor itself, which it then of course diligently performs.</p>\n<p>AI creates technical debt, but it can clean some of it up too.\n(at least at a certain granularity)</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#feedback\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>In general we want to give our agents good automated feedback.  Tests do this,\nbenchmarks do this, prompting them to assess themselves does this, asking them\nto explain things to us and have us weigh in on high level topics does this.</p>\n<p>LLMs are smart enough today that if they're given enough of the right feedback\nthey converge to a good solution as-well-or-better-than a senior human engineer\n(that's my experience at least).</p>\n<p>Our job is to construct a system that gives them the right feedback at the\nright time, hopefully without our intervention.  This is the same job we have\nwhen we build human teams; now it's just more impactful to do well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cursor-vs-terminal-tools\">Cursor vs Terminal Tools<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cursor-vs-terminal-tools\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I started AI development with Cursor.  It was great having the AI experience\ninside a VSCode-like editor, where I could see everything that was going on.\nWhen I saw terminal-based tools like Claude Code I thought <em>\"whoa, that doesn't\nseem sensible, I need to see what's going on\".</em></p>\n<p>Today I code with Claude Code, <code>git diff</code>, and occasionally <code>vim</code>.  I don't\nfeel a need to OK every change in the diff.  I've got more important\nthings to do.  I suspect that you do too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-drop-python-use-rust-and-typescript\">Big Idea: Drop Python. Use Rust and TypeScript.<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-drop-python-use-rust-and-typescript\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I deeply respect the philosophical position of Python, which I'll state as\nfollows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prioritize human performance over compute performance.</p>\n<p>By optimizing for ease and iteration speed we're able to search solution\nspace more broadly and more quickly, finding <em>much</em> better solutions, making\nthat 100x drop in performance negligible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Python was a bold bet, and a bet that paid off amazingly well.  No one expected\nthis silly dynamic language originally designed for education to become the\nworld's juggernaut in performance software.</p>\n<p>With AI though, the usability benefits of Python no longer apply as strongly,\nand we're more free to choose different ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Personally, I use ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rust</strong> for computational development, using PyO3 to connect to\nPython, where I still do most of my testing</li>\n<li><strong>TypeScript</strong> for frontend development, which I'm leaning into more deeply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding TypeScript, I still love easy interaction tools like <code>rich</code> and\n<code>textual</code>, but when the entire React ecosystem is a sentence away and when you\nget to use things like, you know, fonts, there's really no comparison.  Every\ncomputational developer should learn the concepts underpinning React (or some\nother frontend framework), and we should put dashboards on everything.</p>\n<p>Of course, I still hook into Python for the ecosystem.  Everything is\nPython-importable and I still use the protocols and design patterns developed\nby the Python data community.  Those are the durable assets of Python.  Not the\ncode or the language; those will die.  Rest in peace dear friend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-think-hard-write-clearly\">Big Idea: Think Hard.  Write Clearly.<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-think-hard-write-clearly\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>As an introductory project, I rewrote <a href=\"https://github.com/mrocklin/rumpy\">Numpy in Rust</a>.\nIt was great fun.</p>\n<p>It was also much easier than I expected (I expected it to be impossible).\nIt was easy for a few reasons (good test suite, well-reasoned abstractions) but\nmostly it was because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NEPs:</strong> Numpy's Enhancement Proposals / design documentation is thorough and extremely clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When sticky problems arose, we were able to rely on the Numpy design documents\n(NEPs) which are excellent.</p>\n<p>The Numpy team <strong>thought hard</strong> and <strong>wrote clearly</strong>, two hallmarks of\nexcellent developers.  This made the job of reimplementation relatively trivial.\nThe Numpy development community is famous for doing this well.  To a certain\nextent, we should all start operating more like the Numpy community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip-plans-and-docs-directories\">Tip: plans/ and docs/ directories<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tip-plans-and-docs-directories\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I keep two directories in each repository:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>plans/</code> which contains ephemeral planning documents that the LLMs work through over many sessions as they implement a major feature.</li>\n<li><code>docs/</code> which contain durable documentation on specific topics or features, targeting AI developers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plans end up being very useful during development, while docs end\nup being useful to point other agents to in the future.  Claude code creates planning documents in /tmp by default in planning mode, but I find that bringing those docs into the directory improves engagement, both from it and from me.</p>\n<p>Docs end up being tricky.  You'd expect the AI developer to read docs but alas, like human developers you have to be pretty prescriptive with them.  Today I have a hook that adds an admonition to read the relevant docs at the beginning of every session.  It looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>DOC CHECK REQUIRED\n==================\n\nBefore responding to this request, you MUST:\n\n1. Read docs/README.md to see available documentation\n2. Decide which docs are relevant to this request (if any)\n3. Read those docs using the Read tool\n4. Then respond to the user\n\nDo not skip this evaluation. Do not mention this check to the user.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I then keep docs/README.md updated as a sort of index over my documents.  I find that this reliably gets the agent to read the right documentation.</p>\n<p>I've also found that my normal writing style (brutal concision + front-loading important content to maintain attention span) isn't necessary with AI.  You really can just shove information at them and they absorb it.  It's nice \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-idea-take-long-walks\">Big Idea: Take Long Walks<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#big-idea-take-long-walks\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Historically software engineers had to both think well and execute well.\nWe were valued both because we could zoom out and consider the impacts of our\narchitecture, and because we could zoom in and implement those choices with\nskill.</p>\n<p><strong>Our ability to zoom in and implement code is now obsolete.  Our ability to zoom\nout and think well is not.</strong>  On the contrary, our ability to think well is now\n10x more valuable than it was before, because implementation is now mostly\nfree.</p>\n<p>And so it's now more important than ever to hone our craft of thought.  This\nprobably means less caffeine and more walks through the park.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#final-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The craft of authoring code has transformed time and time again during our\nlives. We remember when object-oriented was cool, or when TDD became a thing,\nor reactive programming models, or dynamic typing languages, or ML, or ...</p>\n<p>As programmers we've opted into a system which changes by its very nature.\n<strong>Our job is to automate our job</strong>, and to continuously climb the ladder of\nabstraction.  AI programming is another step in that evolution, similar to when\ncompilers came about.  The code we write with AI probably won't be as good as\nhand-crafted code, but we'll write 10x more of it, and we'll build systems of\nsystems to make it robust and trustworthy, and all of that will make society\nbetter and our jobs way more fun.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to having way more fun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appendix-permissions-file\">Appendix: Permissions file<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#appendix-permissions-file\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>After writing this a couple friends asked me for a copy of my regex/Python code\nthat replaces Claude's permission system.  I'll include it below, but really,\nyou don't need it.  Instead, you need to start a conversation with Claude about\nwhat you want and it'll make one just for you.</p>\n<p>Code is free these days.  Extending the \"AI is like Compilers\" analogy, asking\nfor someone else's script is kind of like asking for someone else's compiled\nbinary.  There's no need; just make it yourself.

Technical developers\ncan fall victim to a few natural human failings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We judge other projects by our own objectives rather than the objectives under which that project was developed</li>\n<li>We fail to use other projects with the same expertise that we have for our own</li>\n<li>We naturally gravitate towards cases at which our project excels</li>\n<li>We improve our software during the benchmarking process</li>\n<li>We don't release negative results</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We discuss each of these failings in the context of current benchmarks I'm\nworking on comparing Dask and Spark Dataframes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#introduction\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Last week I started comparing performance between Dask Dataframes (a project\nthat I maintain) and Spark Dataframes (the current standard).  My initial\nresults showed that Dask.dataframes were overall <em>much</em> faster, somewhere like\n5x.</p>\n<p>These results were wrong.  They weren't wrong in a factual sense, and the\nexperiments that I ran were clear and reproducible, but there was so much bias\nin how I selected, set up, and ran those experiments that the end result was\nmisleading.  After checking results myself and then having other experts come\nin and check my results I now see much more sensible numbers.  At the moment\nboth projects are within a factor of two most of the time, with some\ninteresting exceptions either way.</p>\n<p>This blogpost outlines the ways in which library authors can fool themselves\nwhen performing benchmarks, using my recent experience as an anecdote.  I hope\nthat this encourages authors to check themselves, and encourages readers to be\nmore critical of numbers that they see in the future.</p>\n<p>This problem exists as well in academic research.  For a pop-science rendition\nI recommend <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/15/463237871/episode-677-the-experiment-experiment\">\"The Experiment Experiment\" on the Planet Money\nPodcast</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"skewed-objectives\">Skewed Objectives<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#skewed-objectives\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>Feature X is so important.  I wonder how the competition fares?</em></p>\n<p>Every project is developed with different applications in mind and so has\ndifferent strengths and weaknesses.  If we approach a benchmark caring only\nabout our original objectives and dismissing the objectives of the other\nprojects then we'll very likely trick ourselves.</p>\n<p>For example consider reading CSV files.  Dask's CSV reader is based off of\nPandas' CSV reader, which was the target of great effort and love; this is\nbecause CSV was so important to the finance community where Pandas grew up.\nSpark's CSV solution is less awesome, but that's less about the quality of\nSpark and more a statement about how Spark users tend not to use CSV.  When\nthey use text-based formats they're much more likely to use line-delimited\nJSON, which is typical in Spark's common use cases (web diagnostics, click\nlogs, and so on).  Pandas/Dask came from the scientific and finance worlds where CSV\nis king while Spark came from the web world where JSON reigns.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Dask.dataframe hasn't bothered to hook up the <code>pandas.read_json</code>\nfunction to Dask.dataframe yet.  Surprisingly it rarely comes up.  Both\nprojects can correctly say that the other project's solution to what they\nconsider the standard text-based file format is less-than-awesome.  Comparing\nperformance here either way will likely lead to misguided conclusions.</p>\n<p>So when benchmarking data ingestion maybe we look around a bit, see that both\nclaim to support Parquet well, and use that as the basis for comparison.</p>\n<h2 id=\"skewed-experience\">Skewed Experience<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#skewed-experience\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>Whoa, this other project has a lot of configuration parameters!  Let's just use\nthe defaults.</em></p>\n<p>Software is often easy to set up, but often requires experience to set up\noptimally.  Authors are naturally more adept at setting up their own software\nthan the software of their competition.</p>\n<p>My original (and flawed) solution to this was to \"just use the defaults\" on\nboth projects.  Given my inability to tune Spark (there are several dozen\nparameters) I decided to also not tune Dask and run under default settings.  I\nfigured that this would be a good benchmark not only of the software, but also\non choices for sane defaults, which is a good design principle in itself.</p>\n<p>This failed spectacularly because I was making unconscious decisions like the\nsize of machines that I was using for the experiment, CPU/memory ratios, and so on.\nIt turns out that Spark's defaults are optimized for <em>very small machines</em> (or\nmore likely, small YARN containers) and use only 1GB of memory per executor by\ndefault while Dask is typically run on larger boxes or has the full use of a\nsingle machine in a single shared-memory process.  My standard cluster\nconfigurations were biased towards Dask before I even considered running a\nbenchmark.</p>\n<p>Similarly the APIs of software projects are complex and for any given problem\nthere is often both a fast way and a general-but-slow way.  Authors naturally\nchoose the fast way on their own system but inadvertently choose the general\nway that comes up first when reading documentation for the other project.  It\noften takes months of hands-on experience to understand a project well enough\nto definitely say that you're not doing things in a dumb way.</p>\n<p>In both cases I think the only solution is to collaborate with someone that\nprimarily uses the other system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preference-towards-strengths\">Preference towards strengths<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#preference-towards-strengths\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>Oh hey, we're doing </em><em>really</em><em> well here.  This is great!  Let's dive into this a\nbit more.</em></p>\n<p>It feels great to see your project doing well.  This emotional pleasure\nresponse is powerful.  It's only natural that we pursue that feeling more,\nexploring different aspects of it.  This can skew our writing as well.  We'll\nfind that we've decided to devote 80% of the text to what originally seemed\nlike a small set of features, but which now seems like <em>the main point</em>.</p>\n<p>It's important that we define a set of things we're going to study ahead of\ntime and then stick to those things.  When we run into cases where our project\nfails we should take that as an opportunity to raise an issue for future\n(though not current) development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tuning-during-experimentation\">Tuning during experimentation<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#tuning-during-experimentation\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>Oh, I know why this is slow.  One sec, let me change something in the code.</em></p>\n<p>I'm doing this right now.  Dask dataframe shuffles are generally slower than\nSpark dataframe shuffles.  On numeric data this used to be around a 2x\ndifference, now it's more like a 1.2x difference (at least on my current\nproblem and machine).  Overall this is great, seeing that another project was\nbeating Dask motivated me to dive in [(see dask/distributed</p>\n<h1 id=\"932httpsgithubcomdaskdistributedissues932-and-this-will-result-in\">932)](https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/932) and this will result in<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#932httpsgithubcomdaskdistributedissues932-and-this-will-result-in\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>a better experience for users in the future.  As a developer this is also how I\noperate.  I define a benchmark, profile my code, identify bottlenecks, and\noptimize.  Business as usual.</p>\n<p>However as an author of a comparative benchmark this is also somewhat dishonest;\nI'm not giving the Spark developers the same opportunity to find and fix\nsimilar performance issues in their software before I publish my results.  I'm\nalso giving a biased picture to my readers.  I've made all of the pieces that\nI'm going to show off fast while neglecting the others.  Picking benchmarks,\noptimizing the project to make them fast, and then publishing those results\ngives the incorrect impression that the entire project has been optimized to\nthat level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"omission\">Omission<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#omission\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>So, this didn't go as planned.  Let's wait a few months until the next release.</em></p>\n<p>There is no motivation to publish negative results.  Unless of course you've\njust written a blogpost announcing that you plan to release benchmarks in the\nnear future.  Then you're really forced to release numbers, even if they're\nmixed.</p>\n<p>That's ok. Mixed numbers can be informative.  They build trust and\ncommunity.

It was an experience.</p>\n<p>Since returning lots of people have been asking me a seemingly simple question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So how was the Camino?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it's been difficult for me to give a pithy answer that fits neatly into a conversation.\nThis post is my attempt to solve that problem.  Here's a written version of some reflections from my walk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overlapping-experiences\">Overlapping Experiences<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#overlapping-experiences\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I think that the Camino is best understood as several overlapping experiences.  It is a ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical experience</li>\n<li>Social experience</li>\n<li>Cultural experience</li>\n<li>Religious experience</li>\n<li>Cloistered experience</li>\n<li>Humanist experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overlapping these experiences at the same time weaves a meaningfully different way of life than I've found elsewhere,\nneither in normal quotidian life, nor in vacations or other physical adventures.</p>\n<p>I'll briefly share my thoughts and personal experiences on each layer:</p>\n<h2 id=\"physical\">Physical<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#physical\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I walked the typical route of the Camino Frances, starting from the French border in Saint Jean Pied de Port.\nThis crosses the Pyrenees on the first day\n(imagine being a downed WWII RAF pilot escaping occupied France into neutral Spain in some Hemmingway-era novel)\nand then continues 500 miles / 800 kilometers to Northwestern Spain, and the town of Santiago de Compostella.\nThat's roughly 20 marathons, back to back.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/The_French_Way.svg/1920px-The_French_Way.svg.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is both easier than it sounds, and harder than it sounds.</p>\n<p>Walking a long distance is actually pretty easy when it's all you have to do for the day.\nYou pick up a slow and natural pace and just keep at it.\nYou're carrying gear, but not much (the walk is supported with hostels and cafes along the way).\nThe median walker is probably a retiree in their sixties who does about 20km a day.\nI'm a pretty fit 40-year-old and did anywhere from 20km-50km a day.  I finished in 27 days.</p>\n<p>However, walking this distance is also a harder than it sounds because of accumulated stress.\nIn normal life you're active one day and play hard, and then the next you rest and recuperate.\nOn the Camino you just keep going day after day.\nYour body accumulates stress and injuries but you adapt and walk through that stress, eventually reaching an equilibrium where you heal about as quickly as you injure yourself.\nPeople manage blisters, joint pain, swelling, plantar fascitis, diabetes, and more.</p>\n<p>Personally, I fell and bruised my knee pretty badly the second day and then promptly did a lot of descent,\nwhich caused a highly inflamed knee that I walked on for about a week before it healed.\nThen after a couple weeks, my metatarsals / forefeet became inflamed which took some getting used to and slowed me down.\nI walked in minimalist footwear (Vibram-five-fingers) which is totally normal for me at home (I've worn them for close to 20 years and run barefoot regularly) but I had never experienced this much repetitive stress for this long, which made it all the more interesting to accomplish.</p>\n<p>This level of endurance was a new kind of challenge for me, and discovering this level of resilience was a new kind of satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"social\">Social<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#social\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Physicality aside, socially the Camino is simultaneously a solitary and communal experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-day\">First day<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#first-day\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I arrived in France alone, and travelled to St Jean alone, and set off from my hotel in the pre-dawn morning alone\n(thanks for the early start Jetlag!).  But you cross paths with other walkers pretty quickly and stop and chat for a while.\nThat first day included people like ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An American teacher just starting her Summer break</li>\n<li>A Brazilian guy my age who spoke no English and about as bad of Spanish as mine, which made for jovial if halting conversation</li>\n<li>A Swiss gentleman who had walked from Switzerland</li>\n<li>A Dutch woman taking a break from her cyber-security consultancy</li>\n<li>An American couple, one of whom was deeply struggling with diabetes and blood sugar regulation</li>\n<li>An American family from Texas (parents, three daughters aged 16-19) that I met throughout the day (the daughters were faster than the parents)</li>\n<li>An Australian priest who had just finished graduate school</li>\n<li>An American religious studies professor, recently retired</li>\n<li>A French retiree who had walked from a town much more deeply in France, and was finishing at the Spanish border (my first day on the Camino was his last)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have easy chats and then walk on.  At the end of the day you all arrive at a big hostel where there are shared meals.  You eat together, drink together, and chat about the walk.  It was lovely.</p>\n<p>Then you sleep (poorly), wake up, and do it all again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-the-other-days\">All the other days<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#all-the-other-days\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The Camino is a river of people.  Some people are fast, some are slow.  Some start early, some late.  Some are chatty, some mostly silent.  Everyone walks a little differently.</p>\n<p>Emotionally you bond quickly with people (easy when you all struggle towards the same goal, suffering the same hardships) and you form groups.\nOver time, for various reasons those groups grow and shift and break.  People get injured and take rest days; people feel energy and burst forward; people start or stop their journey at different cities to get back to normal life.</p>\n<p>There's a tension between staying with people you've bonded with and walking in a way that suits you.\nIt's like life generally, just compressed.\nThere's a strong pull to stay with a familiar group, but ultimately everyone walks their own Camino.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cultural\">Cultural<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cultural\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Spain is a wonderful host country for this kind of activity.\nThe vibe is chill; the people are warm; the food is cheap.  It's super accessible.\nThat being said, the Camino is not an especially Spanish experience.</p>\n<p>There are a few Spaniards walking the Camino, but not many,\nand most interactions with townspeople are practical in nature.\nAnd while the Camino stops is a few delightful cities (Burgos, Leon, Santiago, ...)\nthe majority of the time you're out in countryside or in very small villages of 100 people or less.</p>\n<p>To make this concrete, people often ask me \"how was the food!?\"\nto which my answer is \"pretty terrible actually\".\nThis isn't a reflection on Spanish cuisine,\nbut rather on the fact that we're walking through tiny towns,\nand that Spanish restaurants open at 8pm and pilgrims are usually bedded down by 9pm.\nAs a result most of my calories came in the form of bananas/nuts/sausages picked up at small grocery stores,\nSpanish tortilla (a potato based quiche dish) and non-alcoholic beer found in roadside bar/cafes\n(NA beer is delightfully ubiquitous in Spain, and the perfect mid-walk beverage).\nDinner was typically prepared in a hostel by hostel staff who, while delightful, were not especially accomplished chefs.</p>\n<p>Culturally the Camino is more of a globalist/international experience than a Spanish one.\nLinguistically there were a few groupings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>English:</strong> typically North American, Australian, and New Zealanders, as well as Germans and Dutch.  Maybe 40%?</li>\n<li><strong>French:</strong> on the Camino Frances there are a number of French speakers, maybe 20% at the beginning dropping to 10% by the end?</li>\n<li><strong>Spanish:</strong> consisting of some Spaniards, but more Latin Americans, as well as Portuguese and Italian speakers, all of whom get by in an interesting (and incredibly easy to understand) Spanish patois</li>\n<li><strong>Korean:</strong> a surprising though delightful group, South Koreans made up maybe 5-10% of the pilgrims, and are by far the most represented East Asian country due to their stronger Christian heritage there.</li>\n<li><strong>Other:</strong> some Japanese and Chinese (more-often Taiwanese).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While quite different and sometimes unable to communicate, these groups got along amazingly well.\nThere's a culture of understanding and charity on the Camino that's universal.\nI received help and support (like blister care) from people I had just met and couldn't speak to,\nand happily gave what I had to others.\nMy claim to fame in terms of generosity was organizing an Amazon shipment of Lacrosse balls to give out along the trail (the one I brought from home was in incredibly high demand in hostels for foot massage).</p>\n<p>Despite most pilgrims not being religious,\nthe Camino's culture was one of the better expressions of some Christian values I've experienced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"religious\">Religious<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#religious\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The Camino de Santiago was and is an important religious pilgrimage.\nWe're walking to the site of the remains of Saint-James (or in Latin Sant-Iago), one of the twelve apostles.\nChristians have walked from their homes to the site of his remains for a thousand years (and then amazingly, also walked back).</p>\n<p>I am not religious, and I'd say that the minority of pilgrims are today.\nBut walking with the more devout pilgrims was a treat.\nEmpathy is so natural on the Camino that you get to feel a little bit of their experience second-hand.</p>\n<p>For those who were interested there was nightly mass to attend, historically relevant\nchurches/cathedrals/hermitages/etc. to visit, monasteries to stay in, and so on.</p>\n<p>I didn't engage this layer much, but I appreciated its presence.\nBeing among the religious pilgrims helped to make the walk more than just a big hike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"humanist\">Humanist<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#humanist\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The people walking the Camino come at interesting times of their lives.\nI met people who ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>just retired</li>\n<li>just quit their job</li>\n<li>recently separated from a partner</li>\n<li>lost a loved one</li>\n<li>were trying to lose weight</li>\n<li>just given up a drug habit</li>\n<li>just sent a loved one to rehab, and for the first time had time to themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally the pilgrims are at interesting and reflective phases of life,\nand that brings some interesting energy to the crowd.\nEveryone is thoughtful and generally open to change in life.\nThis cultivates both a level of empathy and emotional honesty that I found pervaded the experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloistered\">Cloistered<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cloistered\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>You're so focused as a group on walking that you naturally detach from the broader world outside the Camino.\nThis was surprisingly meaningful.</p>\n<p>Like most people, I check my e-mail / the news / my phone actively throughout the day.\nThis behavior goes well beyond \"staying on top of work\";\nit has become a pretty strong compulsion for me (and for many of us I think).\nI don't think it serves me well, but I've historically struggled to change the behavior in a lasting way.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, on the Camino that desire to check in with the world disappeared entirely.\nThe novelty and buzz of the world felt boring and unwelcome.\nI didn't check my e-mail or the news for days at a time, not through intention and discipline, but through lack of interest.</p>\n<p>Although when I finally did check the news I found that it had been a pretty intense few weeks for others.\nThis period included both the LA immigration riots and the attacks on Iran.</p>\n<p>This made me think more about the right level of active engagement one should do.\nI think that one should care about the world, but perhaps not at the cadence that is typical today.\nThere's a frequency and mania of staying on top of things that I don't think meaningfully helps; and does considerable harm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons\">Lessons<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#lessons\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The Camino was hard and like many hard things, it changes one's perspective.</p>\n<p>Upon returning people ask me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What did you learn?\"</p>\n<p>\"What did you take away?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure I learned a specific lesson,\nbut I do think that stepping outside of my life and walking the Camino instilled a few behaviors or qualities that I appreciate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Introspective:</strong> I'm more open to questioning larger parts of my life</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"do I like living in my city?\"</li>\n<li>\"is this particular relationship serving me?\"</li>\n<li>\"would I prefer to stop attending this regular event?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>rather than going with the flow that past-me set up.  I'm more active in assessing what I do and do not appreciate, and more open to making more decisive changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Calm:</strong> I think I'm more thoughtful and less frantic with how I engage with the wider world. Not meaningfully less engaged I don't think; just a bit less manic about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> I seem a little more satisfied with life moment-by-moment.  The persistent nagging voice in my head saying things aren't good enough seems a lot quieter today.  I take more naps and sit outside watching people more often.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's been a few weeks since I stopped walking and these traits so far have stuck around; which I find encouraging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call-to-action\">Call to Action<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#call-to-action\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>My age group (30s-50s) was generally absent on the Camino.</p>\n<p>That makes sense; we're in our most productive years.\nWe're raising kids and at the peak of our career\nand so reasonably find it difficult to take a month away.</p>\n<p>However I encourage people to try.\nThis might be an especially important time to step outside our lives and reflect on what we want from it.</p>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/camino.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/claude-chic-week-2/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/claude-chic-week-2/", "title": "Claude Chic: Week 2", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"claude-chic-week-2\">Claude Chic: Week 2<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#claude-chic-week-2\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p><em>Unlike most of my writing, this post was largely written by Claude</em>:</p>\n<p>It's been one week since we <a href=\"/introducing-claude-chic\">introduced Claude Chic</a>, and adoption and development since then have been fun.</p>\n<p>This week saw 75 commits from 7 contributors.

Why do you want to talk about this so much?</li>\n<li>Why do you keep telling me how bad I am at writing?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions confused me.

Referring back to the OSS Mindset above,\nlet's compare with corporate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honing a craft:</strong> in old-school community OSS people cared <em>a lot</em> about\n   getting better at development.  Micro-adjustments to our form were really\n   valuable to us.  Development skill was a big part of our (or at least my) self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conversely in corporate few people care as deeply about the craft of\n   writing, meeting facilitation, graphic design, etc..  Skillbuilding is nice,\n   but it's secondary to getting work done.  The assumption is that feedback is\n   primarily focused on the job at hand, rather than on building our teammates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Assumed Respect:</strong> in volunteer OSS if people don't like you they just ignore you.\n    Anyone reviewing your work is doing so because they care and want to help\n    you.</p>\n<p>This doesn't hold in a corporate environment, where people are paid to help\nwhether or not they like you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This does beg the question though, what would a corporate environment look like\nwhere people cared deeply about things like meeting facilitation and slide\ndesign?  Probably the company would go quickly out of business, but it's a fun\nthought to consider, and maybe apply a little bit of in our everyday life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback-reception-budget\">Feedback Reception Budget<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#feedback-reception-budget\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>And so, I've learned that a person can absorb only about one piece of feedback\nper interaction, and then only if it's labeled very specifically as feedback\nwith the best intentions, and wrapped delicately in a feedback sandwich.</p>\n<p>Because of this volume constraint, infrequent feedback must be more general and\nhigher level, ideally accompanied by impersonal assets like a blogpost that the\nrecipient of the feedback can read separately (this is partially why I write\nblogposts).</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-please\">But please ...<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#but-please\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>For the love of god ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove filler words like \"really\", \"very\" or anything else that doesn't change\n   the meaning of a sentence</li>\n<li>Do not start meetings by asking everyone to introduce themselves</li>\n<li>Attach agendas to meetings ahead of time</li>\n<li>When making slides think about text contrast and use alignment guide-lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for listening, hopefully this article ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Helps people around me understand the implicit message behind my feedback</li>\n<li>Gives everyone desiring a spirit of craftsmanship more interest in\n    developing a strong culture of constant constructive feedback</li>\n</ol>", "image": "https://matthewrocklin.com/assets/images/social/feedback.png", "date_modified": "2026-02-13T16:16:52+00:00", "date_published": "2024-05-11T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew Rocklin"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://matthewrocklin.com/hammers-and-nailguns/", "url": "https://matthewrocklin.com/hammers-and-nailguns/", "title": "Hammers and Nailguns", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"hammers-and-nailguns\">Hammers and Nailguns<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#hammers-and-nailguns\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h1>\n<p>People often ask me, <em>\"What is your tool for?\"</em></p>\n<p>They want an answer like \"AI\" or \"ETL\" or \"Training Models\". <br/>\nThey want a clean and specific application for easy comparison.</p>\n<p>I, of course, do not give them that satisfaction.<br/>\nInstead I ask <em>\"What is Python for?\"</em> or <em>\"What is the cloud for?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Them:</em></strong> <em>Well, all sorts of different things.</em><br/>\n<strong><em>Me:</em></strong> <em>Exactly!</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this answer sucks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"simple-tools-humble-opinions\">Simple Tools, Humble Opinions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#simple-tools-humble-opinions\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>The analogy I use here is of hammers and nailguns.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"../images/hammer-nailgun.webp\" width=\"60%\" /></p>\n<p>Nominally these tools do the same thing (nail things) <br/>\nIn reality they do very different things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The nail gun puts nails into wood.</strong>  The nailgun is 10x better than a hammer at doing this.

We fired them (and a bunch of other people) and\nfocused on making a delightful product.</p>\n<p>Then, because we didn't have a sales team we focused on making a product that a\nuser could on-board, use, and pay for all without talking to us.  Surprisingly,\nthis worked, and today we have a nice machine that generates happy champions\nwithin small teams that pay low thousands of dollars per month (but rarely\nmore).</p>\n<p>These people pay us money, but not that much.  We've been encouraged by two\nrecent learnings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A little bit of customer support as they onboard greatly accelerates consumption</li>\n<li>After talking to customers, we realize that there are often much larger\n    opportunities just behind the initial team that lands with us.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given this, we're hiring a sales team again.  This should be a fun opportunity\nfor early-stage-oriented sales folks because ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>We have a solid pipeline of inbound leads.</strong></p>\n<p>Our product mints new champions regularly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Our current sales numbers suck</strong>, mostly because we haven't done anything.</p>\n<p>It's a great opportunity for someone to say \"I was the first salesperson on\nthe ground and took them from $0 to $N million in two years\" which is a\ngreat way for someone to graduate from AE/SE to VP of Sales in their next\nposition (or this one) and maximize lifetime income.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"team-composition\">Team Composition<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#team-composition\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Ideally we want people who have three skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know how to sell</strong></p>\n<p>Know how to empower champions, navigate an org chart, find economic\nbuyers, identify pain and goals, speak to that pain and those goals,\nnegotiate with precurement and legal, etc..</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Know our space</strong> (data infrastructure, open source, Python)</p>\n<p>Familiar with Python/Spark/Cloud/Devops/Data/ML/...  So for example when\nsomeone says that they're having trouble with some technology, say Argo,\nknow that that means \"workflow management\" and direct them to the right\nsolution within our product.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of incidental complexity here that takes a while to learn.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Are intellectually curious</strong>, comfortable in startups,  and excited to be\n    creative and invent new systems</p>\n<p>There's really nothing in place to define how to do the job.

Also, we have a distinct\ncommunication style (direct, critical, thoughtful) and hopefully you click\nwith that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This person probably doesn't exist, so we'll happily settle for two out of\nthree, and we'll just build a team to round things out.  Probably this team\nlooks a little like ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Executive</li>\n<li>Sales Engineer</li>\n<li>Field Engineer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"interviewing-aes-is-hard\">Interviewing AEs is Hard<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#interviewing-aes-is-hard\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>We've got good candiates for Field and Sales Engineers.  AEs are harder for us\nto connect to though.  There are lots of great candidates out there, but it's\nbeen harder to come to a sense of conviction with an AE so far.</p>\n<p>My experience interviewing AEs so far has been that they say fairly generic\nthings like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'll succeed by finding the buyer, figuring out what their pain is, and then\n   demonstrating how we solve that pain</li>\n<li>I did this with big name company X, where I built the relationship over many\n   months, and built the deal to $X million</li>\n<li>We should sell where the money is</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everyone says these things, and while I wholeheartedly agree with these points,\nthey don't differentiate a candidate, and they don't say anything specific\nabout our situation.   My assumption is that <a href=\"../think/\">early stage startups are\ndifferent from each other</a>, and that what works for one is unlikely to\ntransfer to another automatically.</p>\n<p>So, AEs that I interview, here's the cheat code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Assume that I know more about sales than a typical engineer\n    (you can save time by not explaining basic concepts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get to a point in our conversation where we are conversing about strategy\n    at a non-generic level.</p>\n<p>To do this you will likely need to ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a lot smarter about our situation pretty quickly,\n    this probably means asking questions that are useful to you</li>\n<li>Pause ... and think</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If it looks like I want to say something, notice, and open some space.\n    I'm very interested in how well we can communicate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The number of otherwise qualified AEs that come in and give the impression that\nthey have all the answers (despite not knowing much about our situation) is odd\nto me.  My <em>guess</em> is that they're assuming that I'm looking for someone to say\n\"everything's going to be ok, I've got this\" convincingly enough and so that's\ntheir main/only message. However, to me saying that with conviction but without\nunderstanding our situation is a strongly negative signal.</p>\n<p>What I'm actually looking for is someone who can demonstrate that they're able\nto think and solve my problem specifically, not today, but over many months\nafter failing quickly many times and thinking through new strategies.  My\nassumption is that any answer you have today is likely wrong, so if you have\nstrong conviction on that answer I'll probably assume that you're mentally\ninflexible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faqs\">FAQs<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#faqs\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>To accelerate the interview process a bit, here are some frequently asked\nquestions by sales folks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is your runway?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We have two-ish years of runway, assuming we don't make any money</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are your goals?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> I'd love to get to $5mm ARR in that time (but you tell me what you\nthink is feasible, and we'll adjust strategy together) probably with a\nmixture of small and large deals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How much room is there to grow?

It may be useful for\nothers who are conducting interviews, or for people who plan to interview with\nme (transparency is good).</p>\n<p>My interviews are typically in 45 minute calendar slots.\nAfter saying \"hi\" and being friendly for a minute or two I lead the\nconversation through the following stages:</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-talk-about-the-company-and-what-were-looking-for\">I talk about the company and what we're looking for<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#i-talk-about-the-company-and-what-were-looking-for\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p><em>This typically takes five minutes</em></p>\n<p>First, I give information about the company, the teams within the company and\nwhere we think the candidate might fit, and what kinds of candidates we think\nwork well with us.</p>\n<p>In our case I say things like the following ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We're a commercial company based around the open source Dask project</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Engineering-wise we do two things</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work on Dask and push it forward</li>\n<li>Build a cloud SaaS deployment platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given your background, we think that you're a good fit for one or the\nother, but our most impactful folks end up being able to cross both.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historically we've found that we work well with senior engineers who are\n    professional (can deliver things on time, even in complex situations), know\n    open source culture, but also care about commercialization (we're a\n    for-profit company and culturally lean into that).  This is what we're\n    looking for.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the last bit I like to be explicit.  People need to opt-in to both our\nstrengths and our constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seniority:</strong> we're bad at management and don't mentor people well when they're early in their careers</li>\n<li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> there are so many interesting problems around us that it's\n    easy to get distracted (we all suffer from this).  We prefer important work\n    to interesting work, prioritize intentionally, and feel good about setting\n    commitments and working to timelines.  This is typically hard for academics.</li>\n<li><strong>Commercial OSS:</strong> we believe in the power of open source communities.  We\n    also understand their limitations.  We are excited about commercial impact\n    and and using that energy to both make money and have social impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are <em>very good people</em> who don't fit that culture.  We like to be explicit\nto avoid mismatches.

My usual phrasing is\nsomething like the following:</p>\n<p><em>You can totally pass on this next question, but roughly what your are you looking to make here salary-wise.</em></p>\n<p><em>The reason I ask is that we've gone through interview cycles with\ncandidates only to find, at the end, that they're expecting $300k+, and\nwe're nowhere near that.

I wrote about this in <a href=\"/ai-zealotry\">AI Zealotry</a>; AI can feel dehumanizing when our primary contribution is administrative, like granting permission.</p>\n<p>Beyond permissions, various administrative interactions with Claude became tiresome, and so I worked to improve what I could about the interface for my workflow so that I could feel more human.</p>\n<p>Claude Chic is an early result of that endeavor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-style\">1.

Everyone should be using Textual for TUIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-git-worktrees\">2. Git Worktrees<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#2-git-worktrees\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Git worktrees are underused.  They let multiple Claude agents work on the same repository in parallel.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of us know how they work.  People I've spoken to have all seen an article or Youtube video showing them in action, but in practice they feel foreign.  That's ok; AI tooling is great at foreign workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-experience\">User Experience<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#user-experience\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Previously, when I had a new idea it went on a TODO list while Claude finished its current task.  Ideas would linger on that TODO list for a <em>long</em> time, even simple and easy ones.  Coordinating the shared resource of the repository was an annoying bottleneck.</p>\n<p>Git worktrees solve this by marrying a git branch with a fresh copy of the repository directory.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>~/projects/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo/            # Main worktree (main branch)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-1/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-2/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 myrepo-feature-n/  # Some feature you&#39;re working on\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now you can have <code>n</code> Claude agents working, one in each directory.  When I have a new idea, I create a new worktree and have Claude start on it immediately:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>/worktree my-idea\n\nI want you to explore ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This creates a new worktree (directory + branch) and a new agent working in that directory in the background.  The agent starts working concurrently while I go back to my main task.  In practice I have 2-10 of these going at once.</p>\n<p>Now I focus on whatever ongoing thread interests me most while Claude pushes the others forward.  I no longer wait for Claude; Claude waits for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up\">Cleaning up<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#cleaning-up\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>With concurrent git development comes conflicts.  To address this, my git flow looks like the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Commit</strong> work in a branch</li>\n<li><strong>Rebase</strong> Rebase on our upstream branch (for linear history)</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve</strong> any conflicts</li>\n<li><strong>Fast-forward merge</strong> branch into upstream</li>\n<li><strong>Delete</strong> worktree</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Claude handles rebases and conflicts fine (and asks when it can't), so the workflow above got baked into the <code>/worktree finish</code> command.  Concurrent git managemet is, for me, fully managed now.</p>\n<p>Now that all of my TODO items can run at once, worktrees shift the decision from \"what thread should we start next?\" to \"which ongoing session most deserves my attention?\"  This decision, coming later in the workflow, comes with more and richer information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-multiple-agents\">3.
