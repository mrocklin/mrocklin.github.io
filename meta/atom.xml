&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best way you can contribute to an open source project is to remove lines of code from it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We should endeavor to write code that a novice programmer can easily
understand without explanation or that a maintainer can understand without
significant time investment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As students we attempt increasingly challenging problems with increasingly
sophisticated technologies.  We first learn loops, then functions, then
classes, etc..  We are praised as we ascend this hierarchy, writing longer
programs with more advanced technology.  We learn that experienced programmers
use monads while new programmers use for loops.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Avoid Slack</title>

&lt;p&gt;I avoid interacting on Slack, especially for technical conversations around
open source software.  Instead, I encourage colleagues to have technical and
design conversations on GitHub, or some other system that is public, permanent,
searchable, and cross-referenceable.  In the spirit of Don’t Repeat Yourself
(DRY) I’m writing up these thoughts as a blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is a great tool.  Slack is a great way for colleagues within an
institution or group to communicate real-time with chat, voice, or video.
Slack is probably the most polished of the enterprise chat tools, and today is
something that probably most companies and collaborations should use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development is both a highly technical and a highly creative process.
Programmers are reasonably proud of their abilities and experience,
much in the same way that expert artists or artisans can be proud of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, like art, there is no obvious scale on which to measure programmers.
We throw around terms like “junior engineer” and “senior engineer” on job
titles and resumes, but there isn’t a clear definition for these terms.
If you look online you’ll find a variety of definitions from a variety of
bloggers.  This article is one such blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech lead is a role for senior engineers that provides some of the leverage of
management, while avoiding most of the administrative burden.  It’s a fun role.
This post talks about some positive behaviors to think about should you find
yourself in this role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, tech leads &lt;em&gt;lead&lt;/em&gt; larger technical efforts.
They work with a team, but typically don’t formally manage anyone.
The team looks up to them and it’s their job to steer the effort technically,
while typically only using the soft power of generally knowing what they’re
doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often need to balance prioritization between user-facing work and internal
or developer-facing work.  It’s helpful to distinguish between these in
conversations of prioritization and measuring success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is work that directly affects users.  It solves their pain and gives them

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one knows how to do your job.  Look for answers from within, not without.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

historical set of rules that “just work”.  Your best bet is to question
everything, apply rational thought, and course correct shamelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
